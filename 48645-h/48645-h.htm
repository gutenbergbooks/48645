<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Some years ago I prepared a <cite>Manual of Library Cataloguing</cite>, which
met with more acceptance than was expected, and has been out of print
for some time. Upon considering requests for a new edition, I concluded
that a book upon somewhat different lines would be more likely to meet
the present requirements of librarians and library assistants&mdash;this
volume is the result.</p>

<p>No pretence is made that the work is exhaustive or complete, but it is
hoped that it will serve as a practical and useful introduction to the
several codes of cataloguing rules. The statements made in it are not
meant to be dogmatic, but they indicate the lines upon which good and
accurate work is to be accomplished. As the illustrative examples were
chosen from every-day books, and are worked out as simply as possible,
they should be found useful by beginners; especially in preparing for
the examinations of the Library Association in this subject.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my friend Mr. Frank Pacy, City Librarian of
Westminster, for reading my proofs and suggesting many improvements,
although I am sure he would not care to accept responsibility for all
the views expressed or the mode of expressing them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

Introductory.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The difficulties of Cataloguing a Library. The qualities
desirable in a Cataloguer. The necessity for Systematic
Cataloguing.</p></div>


<p>Among the varied duties of a librarian that of cataloguing his books
is generally supposed by the uninitiated to be one of the easiest. The
popular idea is that books are sent to libraries&mdash;public libraries
at any rate&mdash;by grateful publishers, when all the librarian has to
do is "to catalogue them," put them up in rows on shelves, and hand
them out to the first person who asks for them. The cataloguing of a
library is ranked with that of any other inventory, and a catalogue
popularly regarded as a mere list, calling for no particular knowledge,
effort, or care in its production. The late Prof. John Fiske opens an
interesting essay on "A Librarian's Work" in his <cite>Darwinism and other
Essays</cite> (Macmillan, 1879) in these words, which are equally applicable
to any library of any pretension:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am very frequently asked what in the world a librarian can
find to do with his time, or am perhaps congratulated on my
connection with Harvard College Library, on the ground that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
"being virtually a sinecure office (!) it must leave so much
leisure for private study and work of a literary sort." Those
who put such questions, or offer such congratulations, are
naturally astonished when told that the library affords enough
work to employ all my own time, as well as that of twenty
assistants; and astonishment is apt to rise to bewilderment
when it is added that seventeen of these assistants are
occupied chiefly with "cataloguing;" for, generally, I find,
a library catalogue is assumed to be a thing that is somehow
"made" at a single stroke, as Aladdin's palace was built,
at intervals of ten or a dozen years, or whenever a "new
catalogue" is thought to be needed. "How often do you make a
catalogue?" or "When will your catalogue be completed?" are
questions revealing such transcendent misapprehension of the
case that little but further mystification can be got from the
mere answer, "We are <em>always</em> making a catalogue, and it will
<em>never</em> be finished."</p></div>

<p>Prof. Fiske then proceeds to describe the difficulties of cataloguing
a library: "just cataloguing a book" not being by any means so
simple a task; and he goes on to demonstrate that the work requires
"considerable judgment and discrimination" besides "a great deal of
slow, plodding research." Perhaps there is no literary labour of the
kind, mere "hewing of wood and drawing of water" though it be, that
so quickly takes the conceit out of those essaying it, they finding
it both "arduous and perplexing." "The peculiarities of titles are,
like the idiosyncrasies of authors, innumerable. Books are in all
languages and treat of subjects as multitudinous as the topics of
human thought." A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> cataloguer should be learned in the history
of all literary, scientific, religious, philosophical, economic, and
political movements of all ages and all countries, and especially must
he be abreast of the times in a knowledge of men and things, literary,
scientific, and otherwise. He needs be something of a linguist, should
be exact, orderly, methodical, with fixed ideas and yet an open mind,
painstaking, and persevering. Even with the exercise of all these
attainments and qualities, his work will not be found to be beyond
criticism. No pretence is made to assert that cataloguers as a body
do conform to this ideal; if they did it is probable they would find
more profitable employment. The next best thing to possessing these
qualifications, however, is to have as many as can be attained, and
make up for the rest by knowing where to find information as needed. If
the cataloguer be not "a walking encyclop&aelig;dia" in himself, he at least
should know how to utilise the printed ones, and all other literature
at his command.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of library catalogues ranging from the mere lists
made by private persons of their own books to the great "Catalogue of
Printed Books in the British Museum," which is so extensive by reason
of the number of books contained in it, that its entries are virtually
limited to a single item for each book. Whether small or great, the
principles governing their compilation are much the same, the following
chapters being principally intended as a guide to the cataloguing of a
public library of average size.</p>

<p>No matter how good a library may be, its collections are practically
lost and useless without an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> adequate, properly-compiled catalogue. As
Carlyle puts it "A big collection of books without a good catalogue is
a Polyphemus with <em>no</em> eye in his head." Even an indifferent library
can be made to render comparatively good service with a good catalogue.
In order to compile such a catalogue it is essential that certain
particulars be given descriptive of the books, and in so systematic
a way that, while the entries will afford all reasonable information
to the person well-versed in books, they shall, at the same time, be
so clear and simple in character as to be understood without much
effort by anyone of average intelligence. These particulars should be
comprehensive enough to afford some general idea of the nature and
scope of the book described without actually examining it, though in
this respect much depends upon the character and resources of the
library. The full descriptions usual in special bibliographies meant
for experts are not to be expected or required in the catalogue of a
popular general library.</p>

<p>The value of a good catalogue does not depend upon its extent or
size any more than does that of a good book, but rather upon the
exactness of the method by which the information given is digested and
concentrated. There are library catalogues so elaborately compiled and
imposing in appearance that they might be, and often are, considered
to be most excellent productions, whereas those who use them find
them little more than a medley of book-titles&mdash;pedantic without
being learned. On the other hand, "infinite riches in a little room"
would often be an appropriate motto for some insignificant-looking
catalogue. Sometimes it happens that quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> a small library has a large
catalogue. This does not always arise from a desire to make the most
of the library, but may, likely enough, be owing to the fact that the
compilation was undertaken by some over-zealous committeeman or other
amateur, who, being "fond of books," considered this a sufficient
qualification for cataloguing them without knowing that it is far
easier to over-catalogue a library than to do the work judiciously&mdash;the
result being both wasteful and disastrous. The first catalogues of the
smaller public libraries are sometimes of this character, not always
for the reason just stated; probably owing to the desire to save the
salary of the librarian by postponing his appointment to the last
moment. He is then expected to select and purchase the books as well as
produce a printed catalogue of them within a few weeks: the conception
being that a library can be selected, arranged, and listed in bulk as
goods are bought, displayed, and ticketed in a shop, and in as short
a time. The cataloguing, then, has perforce to be delegated to an
assistant, who possibly has no training whatever. For this reason and
others the catalogue of a new public library can seldom be taken as
representing the knowledge or ability of the librarian as a cataloguer.</p>

<p>With the spread and rise in the standard of education, more exact and
better work is now demanded in libraries than was the case during
the early years after the passing of the first Public Libraries
Act. The slipshod, unsystematic cataloguing at one time in vogue is
not acceptable now, and the public demands something more than bald
lists compiled upon no principle in particular, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> are often more
bewildering than helpful to an inquiring reader. The student and that
interesting person "the general reader" have a better understanding
than formerly of the uses and peculiarities of books, and look for
precise information concerning them. No better evidence of the general
interest taken in books is needed than that afforded by the large place
occupied by the reviewing of literature of all kinds in the daily
press and popular journals, even in minor periodicals. There must be
a public for such reviews, otherwise editors would not provide them;
and, no doubt, the spread of libraries has something to do with it. The
old dictum that it was not the business of a cataloguer to go behind,
or add to, the information deemed sufficient by an author for the
title-page of his book does not now find acceptance.</p>

<p>Those who are possessed of even a little experience will know that it
is impossible to compile a library catalogue in a haphazard fashion,
and that clear and definite rules for guidance must be laid down before
any part of the work is attempted, otherwise confusion and want of
proportion will result, to say nothing of the likelihood of the loss
of work already done. Happily for a number of years now the rules
governing the proper compilation of catalogues have been codified, and
the following chapters, while based upon no particular code, are meant
to serve as a practical introduction to the best-known of them with
some little modifications that have been found to be convenient in
practice.</p>

Catalogues. Huggins' Liverpool Catalogue. Cutter's Rules.

<p>Before proceeding to consider the practical side of the subject, we
may take a brief glance at the history of <em>modern</em> cataloguing of
public libraries in this country. The earlier catalogues were limited
either to author-entries or were classified according to the whims of
the compiler, sometimes according to the rooms or shelves in which the
books were placed.</p>

<p>The subject of cataloguing received the most serious attention in the
year 1850, and, roundly, we may date its history from then. "The Rules
for the Compilation of the Catalogue of Printed Books in the Library of
the British Museum" had been adopted in 1839, and were printed in 1841.
In a great measure they may be regarded as the basis of all cataloguing
rules since that time, at any rate for author-entry or its equivalent.
In 1850 a Royal Commission on the management of the British Museum
had sat and issued its report, and rate-supported public libraries
were coming into existence. There had been much discussion on the need
for an adequate and promptly-produced catalogue of the books in the
Museum, and many views upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> the subject were set forth, especially
by literary experts. Their criticism was in the main directed against
the existing rules known as Panizzi's. Anthony Panizzi, then Principal
Librarian, with others of the Museum staff, including Thomas Watts,
Winter Jones, and Edward Edwards, had each separately prepared a set of
rules according to his own ideas for the compilation of the projected
catalogue, and these were afterwards discussed by the compilers
collectively, and differences of opinion decided by vote.</p>

<p>The Secretary of this Royal Commission was J. Payne Collier, and he was
one of the opposers of Panizzi's rules, especially taking exception
to the fulness of entry because of the delay it entailed. To show
practically how he would catalogue he tried his hand on twenty-five
books in his own library and submitted the results. Mr. Winter
Jones reported upon it, and said it contained almost every possible
error which can be committed in cataloguing books. Payne Collier's
attempt and his justification of it appear in the first part of the
<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1850, where it will be seen that a German
edition of Shakespeare is entered under the editor alone, and a play
of Aristophanes is also so treated, besides other mistakes of a very
amateurish nature.</p>

<p>In this same year (1850) attention was being directed in America to
library cataloguing. The Smithsonian Institution sent out a circular to
the effect that, being desirous of facilitating research in literature
and science, and of thus aiding in the increase and diffusion of
knowledge, it had resolved to form a general catalogue of the various
libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> in the United States. The librarian of the institution,
Prof. Charles C. Jewett, had prepared plans for the accomplishment of
this object. The first part related to the stereotyping of catalogues
by separate titles in a uniform style. This stereotyping was proposed
to save time, labour, and expense in the preparation of new editions
of such a general catalogue. Only as many copies as were needed for
present use were to be struck off, and then new editions were to be
printed from time to time with later additions also in stereotype. This
idea, though it crops up from time to time, has now no novelty about
it, though recent inventions in type-setting machines have certainly
given cause for its reconsideration. No plan of this kind, particularly
if it were to be co-operative among the libraries, could be of the
least value unless there were uniformity of compilation according to
fixed rules, and so the second part consists of a set of general rules
to be recommended for adoption by the different libraries of the United
States in the preparation of their catalogues. Jewett's code was based
upon Panizzi's "Rules for the British Museum," with modifications
and additions to suit them to general use, and more especially in
connection with his proposed co-operative catalogue. Upon this point
he says, "The rules for cataloguing must be stringent, and should meet
as far as possible all difficulties of detail. Nothing, so far as can
be avoided, should be left to the individual taste or judgment of the
cataloguer. He should be a man of sufficient learning, accuracy, and
fidelity, to apply the rules." In order to emphasise further the need
for uniformity, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> proceeds to say that "if the one adopted were
that of the worst of our catalogues, if it were strictly followed in
all alike, their uniformity would render catalogues thus made far
more useful than the present chaos of irregularities." From his point
of view of a national catalogue, he was perfectly right, though for
general cataloguing the argument is not convincing. Probably there is
room for a greater degree of uniformity in the catalogues of public
libraries than exists at present, and a better understanding upon this
point might be of some advantage to readers and workers generally. The
fact that catalogue rules of a standard kind exist does not seem to
have exercised any great influence in this respect.</p>

<p>The full title of Jewett's work is "On the Construction of Catalogues
of Libraries and their Publication by means of separate Stereotyped
Titles, with Rules and Examples, by Chas. C. Jewett, Librarian of the
Smithsonian Institution, Washington." The first edition was issued
in 1852, and another in the following year. The number of rules is
thirty-nine, and they are furnished with a series of examples and a
specimen subject-index. This may be regarded as the first code of rules
which contains subject-entries as well as author-entries.</p>

<p>In 1856, some two years before Jewett put his rules into practice in a
catalogue of the Boston Public Library, Mr. A. Crestadoro published a
pamphlet on "The Art of Making Catalogues of Libraries." The system he
recommended was to compile the catalogue with the titles of the books
given fully, leading off with the author's names, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> arranged in no
particular order. These entries were to be consecutively numbered. To
this list of books there was to be an index of authors and subjects
in a brief form with the number referring to the entry in the main
catalogue. The subject-words were to be taken from the titles of the
books themselves and accordingly books with synonymous titles were
entered under those titles with such cross-references as were needed.
This method was put into force by Crestadoro when librarian of the
Manchester Public Library, and the catalogue still remains in use for
the older books in the Reference Library there. The first volume was
published in 1864, the entries being numbered from 1 to 26,534, though
they are arranged more or less alphabetically under authors' names, or
the principal subject-words if anonymous. To this volume is attached a
brief subject-matter index. Two later volumes were published in 1879,
and in these the books are apparently entered very much as they were
received into the Library. A separate volume, however, serves as an
index, both of authors and subjects, to all three volumes, and this
volume is still the real finding catalogue, the volumes with the full
particulars being little used in comparison.</p>

<p>This index-form of brief entries of authors and subjects in one
alphabet was utilised for catalogues of lending libraries in
Manchester; the following example of later date being taken from one of
these:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>A similar arrangement was also adopted for the Birmingham Public
Library by the late J. D. Mullins in 1869.</p>

<p>At this time, or a little earlier, Samuel Huggins, a retired architect,
was engaged by the Liverpool Corporation to compile a catalogue of
the Public Reference Library there. He took Jewett's Catalogue of the
Boston Public Library as his model, but with certain modifications. He
says "in the shaping out of all its chief features&mdash;Poetry, Painting,
Music, Architecture, the Drama, Novels, and the Bible group, it has
been so treated as to constitute it an original and unique catalogue,
which in regard both to form and detail of these great departments of
the field of knowledge is superior, so far as I know, to any other work
of the kind. The subjects generally are more concentrated, brought
into fewer and larger groups than in the excellent catalogue just
named"&mdash;that is Jewett's Boston one. One of the principles that he lays
down is that a book of science or art with a geographical limitation
will be found not under the scientific subject of which it treats,
but under the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> the country or place to which the scientific
research is confined, and so a book on the conchology of France does
not appear under Conchology but under France&mdash;subject division "Natural
History." Mr. Huggins apparently was not satisfied that this idea met
all needs as he printed an appendix to his volume "wherein for the
greater convenience of the student, those works in the catalogue which,
by the geographical principle of distribution, are classed under the
places to which their subjects respectively are confined, and so,
wide scattered, are brought together, and grouped according to their
subject." The work was published in 1872, its main principles being
more distinctly those we now understand by the form "a dictionary
catalogue" and it was probably the first of the kind in this country.
Under the older index catalogues a book upon Palestine might be under
such headings as Palestine, Holy Land, Land of Promise, Lands of the
Bible, Bible Lands, or any other title adopted by the authors on their
title-pages, whereas these were all concentrated under a single heading
with such reasonable references and cross-references as were needed
to bind the whole together or "syndetic" as Cutter terms it. This
catalogue is still in use in the Liverpool Reference Library, but has
been improved in detail in the later supplementary volumes, including
the elimination of the form-headings, of which Mr. Huggins made so much.</p>

<p>Other developments in library cataloguing about this period lay more
in the direction of attempts to combine the hitherto almost general
classified catalogues with subject and author catalogues in the
unsatisfactory alphabetico-classed form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to this time, however, there was no adequate code of rules suited to
all requirements. As we have seen, the British Museum rules were for
author-entry, and Jewett's were by no means complete enough for the
purpose. In 1876, Mr. C. A. Cutter published his "Rules for a Printed
Dictionary Catalogue," this work forming the second volume or part of
the "Special Report of the U.S. Bureau of Education on the History,
Condition, and Management of Public Libraries in the United States of
America." These rules numbered 205 as compared with Jewett's 39, and
Mr. Cutter put them into use in, if they were not actually based upon,
his large <cite>Catalogue of the Library of the Boston Athen&aelig;um</cite>. A second
edition of these rules, with corrections and additions, was issued as a
separate work in 1889, a third in 1891, and a fourth in 1904. This last
edition contained Mr. Cutter's latest corrections and additions (he
died in September, 1903), the number of rules being increased thereby
to 369. It is at present the standard and most exhaustive work of the
kind, and is unlikely to be soon superseded, though it will be improved
upon from time to time as library practice requires and its essential
principles become embodied in other codes. Librarians of all ranks are
indebted to the American Government for the generosity with which they
distributed it freely to applicants.</p>

<p>Both the American and British Library Associations formulated
rules&mdash;the former in 1878 and the latter in 1883&mdash;though neither can be
said to have been of much service, the American being a condensation
of Cutter with some unimportant variations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> and the British getting
no further than author and title entries. The two Associations have
now combined in a series of rules known as the "Anglo-American
code" and entitled "Cataloguing Rules, Author and Title Entries,
compiled by Committees of the American Library Association and of the
Library Association." This was published in 1908, and the history
of its production forms a preface to the work. A fuller history and
description of it by the Secretary of the British Committee, Mr. John
Minto, is contained in the <cite>Library Association Record</cite>, volume
11, 1909. A noteworthy statement he makes is "I do not think that it
was supposed to be the business of the Committee to provide for the
needs of very small libraries, which, on account of the inadequacy of
their funds, are unable to provide full catalogues, and are obliged
to be content with mere title-a-line lists. The requirements of such
libraries are already well served with existing codes&mdash;for example
Cutter's Rules which provide alternative forms, short, medium, and
full, for various grades of libraries." For this very reason the
Anglo-American code will never find much favour for practical use
in this country, though it is at present the basis for the Library
Association examinations in this subject.</p>

<p>In 1886 Prof. Dziatzko published his "Instruction f&uuml;r die Ordnung
der Titel im alphabetischen Zettelkatalog der K&ouml;niglichen und
Universit&auml;ts-Bibliothek zu Breslau" which Mr. K. A. Linderfelt of
Milwaukee translated and adapted in 1890, with the other standard
rules, under the title "Eclectic Card Catalog Rules, Author and Title
Entries, based on Dziatzko's 'Instruction' compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the Rules of
the British Museum, Cutter, Dewey, Perkins, and other Authorities."
It is so ample in its details that it covers all possible forms of
authors' names and is therefore most valuable for reference or for
compiling any catalogues, though it may contain a great deal that is
rarely required in average library practice. The appendix, containing a
list of oriental titles and occupations with their significance, is a
useful feature of the work.</p>

<p>So many classified catalogues have appeared of late years arranged
according to the Dewey Decimal System that no notes upon the history of
cataloguing would be complete without some reference to that system.
There is no doubt that it is mainly responsible for the revival of this
form of catalogue. The system was planned or invented by Mr. Melvil
Dewey, when librarian of Amherst College, U.S.A., and was in the first
instance intended for cataloguing and indexing purposes, though it is
now more commonly used for classifying and numbering the books upon the
shelves. It was the result of a good deal of careful study of library
needs and, on the face of it, is simple and practical. As to this Dewey
says "in all the work philosophical theory and accuracy have been
made to yield to practical usefulness. The impossibility of making a
satisfactory classification of all knowledge, as preserved in books,
has been appreciated from the first, and nothing of the kind attempted.
Theoretical harmony and exactness have been repeatedly sacrificed to
the practical requirements of the library."</p>

<p>In spite of this statement it is astonishing how few defects it has
as a system of classification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> especially when it is remembered
that every class and every subject is divided into ten heads. This
limitation has the tendency to congest some subjects while others do
not admit of the use of so many as ten numbers. Withal it is very
elastic and useful, though, as may be expected, things American get
preferential and fuller treatment. The first edition was published
from Amherst College Library in 1876, the second from Columbia College
Library in 1885, the third in 1888, the fourth from the New York State
Library in 1891; the last ("edition 7") being that of 1911, each being
a revision and enlargement of the earlier edition. The very full index
attached to the scheme makes it comparatively easy to use, but, in the
process of using, it is astonishing how many books have to be specially
considered as to their correct place, a comparison of catalogues
compiled under the system showing that different minds have interpreted
the scheme quite differently.</p>

<p>There are other schemes of classification applicable to cataloguing,
as for instance that known as the "Expansive," the compilation of the
late C. A. Cutter, and the "Adjustable" of Mr. J. D. Brown. This last
is used in several public libraries worked upon what is termed the
"open access" system. The earlier history of classified cataloguing is
treated fully enough for most purposes in Mr. J. D. Brown's books on
library classification.</p>

<p>Even this mere sketch in outline of cataloguing history would be
incomplete without some allusion to the printing of the "British
Museum Catalogue of Printed Books." The printing of the first portion,
containing the books to the end of 1881, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> work of twenty years,
and consists of 393 parts, which superseded more than 2,000 folio
volumes of the manuscript catalogue. The supplement containing the
books added to the Museum during the years 1882-1899 was completed in
1905, and those who have the opportunity of constant reference to the
pages of the complete work know how valuable&mdash;even indispensable&mdash;it
is, and look forward to the appearance of the next supplement.
Decennial supplements would be none too frequent.</p>

<p>When to-day so many excellent catalogues of libraries are produced
it would be invidious to single out any for special praise, but no
excuse is needed for naming that of the London Library published in
1903 with its subject volume of 1909, both volumes being remarkable
for condensation and accuracy. At this time (1913) a new revised and
enlarged edition is announced for publication.</p>

<p>Mr. H. B. Wheatley's interesting little book, "How to Catalogue a
Library," must not be overlooked in connection with the history of
modern library cataloguing, particularly the chapter on "The Battle of
the Rules."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

Dictionary <i>versus</i> Classified Catalogues.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Form to be fixed. The users of Catalogues. Questions Catalogues
are expected to answer. The Dictionary Catalogue. The
Classified Catalogue. The Alphabetico-Classed Catalogue.
Definitions.</p></div>


<p>We now proceed to consider the needs of those for whom our catalogues
are prepared.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that most of those who use this book are engaged
in municipal or similar libraries, where the requirements of the many
must be taken into account rather than the special needs of the few.
For those who have yet to acquire experience it is as well to state
that in cataloguing, as in most other departments of library work, a
definite decision as to the form and methods to be adopted must be made
at the outset, as it is impossible to start upon one form and then
change to another without confusion or the sacrifice of work already
done. Then, again, readers as a rule are extremely conservative, and
not only dislike a change but are quick to resent it even when the
advantages are sufficiently obvious to warrant it. Librarians and their
assistants, too, get accustomed to a particular method, and after
several years of working find it difficult to make a change to another
without it affecting their work, often unconsciously.</p>

<p>The spread of education and reading nowadays would lead us to suppose
that most people possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> a sufficient amount of general knowledge to
enable them to make an intelligent use of a catalogue, provided it is
compiled upon well-defined and logical principles. Should the compiler
happen to have all the accomplishments named in Chapter I., and yield
to the temptation to air them by the production of a highly scientific
catalogue, he will find that his labours are unappreciated, and that he
must adapt his work to the needs of the average "man in the street."
Mr. H. B. Wheatley says as to this "that some persons seem to think
that everything is to be brought down to the comprehension of the fool;
but if by doing this we make it more difficult for the intelligent
person, the action is surely not politic. The consulter of a catalogue
might at least take the trouble to understand the plan upon which it
is compiled before using it." Mr. Wheatley's experience is not that of
public librarians generally, as not one person in a thousand does take
this trouble.</p>

<p>However this may be, there is no difficulty in attaining the happy
medium whereby the ignorant (speaking, of course, comparatively) finds
his wants met as readily as the most learned, and with simplicity and
thoroughness. It has been put in other words thus: "The right doctrine
for a public library catalogue is that it should be made not from the
scientific cataloguer's point of view, with a minimum of indulgence for
ignoramuses, but from the ignoramus's point of view with a minimum,
of indulgence for the scientific cataloguer. That the person who not
only does not know but does not even know <em>how to search</em> should be
primarily provided for." Therefore this idea of suiting the needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> of
the particular public using the library must never be overlooked by the
cataloguer.</p>

<p>Besides considering what are likely to be the needs of the majority of
the readers who will use the library to be catalogued, we must decide
what is the maximum amount of information that the catalogue should
afford them, also which form will give the most of this information
with the least trouble and delay to the inquirer.</p>

<p>What are the questions likely to be asked that a catalogue can be
reasonably expected to answer? These do not exceed a dozen, and are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1.&mdash;Have you a particular book by a given author?</p>

<p>2.&mdash;What books have you by a given author?</p>

<p>3.&mdash;What books in the library has a particular person edited,
translated, or illustrated?</p>

<p>4.&mdash;What books have you upon a specific subject? say roses.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;What books are there relating to a general subject? say all
kinds of flowers.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;What books have you in a particular class of literature?
say biography or theology.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;What books have you in a particular language?</p>

<p>8.&mdash;What books have you in a particular literature? say French.
(This is a somewhat remote but not unreasonable question.)</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Have you a book (author unnamed) bearing a particular
title? and, on the same footing with this inquiry, Have
you any of the series called so and so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>10.&mdash;What books have you in a particular form of literature? as
poetry.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;Have you a novel or other work by a particular author
dealing with a particular period? or any similar question
relating to the inner nature of a book.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;In what volume of an author's works is a particular essay
contained? (This last question is really the same as the
first in another form.)</p></div>

<p>The first and second questions will be answered by a catalogue
consisting of author-entries, that is a dictionary of authors, or
if compiled under the British Museum rules it will answer these
and the third also to a large extent. In addition it should answer
No. 12. Questions 4, 5, 6, and 10 can be answered by means of the
catalogue known as classified&mdash;the entries being arranged in general
classes and sub-divided as necessary, but logically, according to the
scientific relations of the subjects of the books. If an author-index
is added other questions also would be answered with a little
trouble. The same questions will be answered by the form known as
alphabetico-classed&mdash;that is a catalogue of subject, class, and form
entries arranged alphabetically.</p>

<p>No one style of catalogue, however, will answer all of these questions,
but the one that will answer most of them with the least trouble and
loss of time to the user is that known as the dictionary catalogue.
It consists of an arrangement of author, subject, and (to a limited
extent) title entries in a single alphabetical sequence, and is by far
the most popular form. It is neither economical nor the most logical,
but its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> convenience for ready reference compensates for these defects.
It ordinarily answers questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and can be made to
answer questions 3, 7, 11, and 12&mdash;that is nine questions out of the
twelve.</p>

<p>The two most common forms of catalogues are the dictionary and the
classified. For many years much controversy has arisen respecting
their comparative usefulness, and there is much to be said in favour
of both, each having merits, as already shown, not possessed by
the other. The late C. A. Cutter points out the advantages of the
classified catalogue, thus: "One who is pursuing any general course
of study finds brought together in one part of the catalogue most of
the books he needs. He sees not merely books on the particular topic
in which he is interested, but in immediate neighbourhood works on
related topics, suggesting to him courses of investigation which he
might otherwise overlook. He finds it an assistance to have all these
works spread out before him, so that he can take a general survey of
the ground before he chooses his route; and as he goes back, day after
day, to his particular part of the catalogue he becomes familiar with
it, turns to it at once, and uses it with ease. The same is true of
the numerous class who are not making any investigation or pursuing
any definite course of study, but are merely desultory readers. Their
choice of books is usually made from certain kinds of literature or
classes of subjects. Some like poetry or essays or plays [curiously he
omits novels]; others like religious works, or philosophical works,
or scientific works, not caring about the particular subject of the
book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> so much as whether it be well-written or interesting. To these
persons it is a convenience that their favourite kind of reading should
all be contained in one or two parts of the catalogue, and freed from
the confusing admixture of titles of a different sort. An alphabetical
list of specific subjects is to them little more suggestive than an
alphabetical list of authors. It is true that by following up all the
references of a dictionary catalogue under Theology, for example, a man
may construct for himself a list of the theological literature in the
library; but to do this requires time and a mental effort, and it is
the characteristic of the desultory reader that he is averse to mental
effort. What is wanted by him and by the busy man when now and then he
has the same object, is to find the titles from which he would select
brought together within the compass of a few pages; few, that is, in
comparison with the whole catalogue. It may be 500 pages, but 500 pages
are better than 10,000. The classed catalogue is better suited also
than any other to exhibit the richness of the library in particular
departments."</p>

<p>Cutter, at the same time, proceeds to name some of the disadvantages
of this style of catalogue. "A large part of the public are not
pursuing general investigations. They want to find a particular book
or a particular subject quickly; and the necessity of mastering a
complex system before using the catalogue is an unwelcome delay or
an absolute bar to its use." Then, again, there is the difficulty of
want of agreement as to classifications. The simple remedy for such
difficulty is an alphabetical index of all the subjects appearing in
the catalogue, whereby an inquirer is directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> to the particular part
of the catalogue in which he will find books upon the subject or topic
he wants. There are very few, if any, catalogues of the kind without
indexes now, though in the early days they were seldom provided.</p>

<p>As said already, early catalogues of libraries were mostly either
classified or simply author catalogues. The classification was, often
enough, very poor, the sub-division not being carried very far, and
this led to the invention or evolution of the dictionary catalogue and
brought the classified, such as it was, into disrepute.</p>

<p>The cataloguing of a library is one of the most troublesome and
expensive departments of its administration. The cost of printing is
greater than ordinary printing, and the expense to a library with
its limited income is always serious, because people will not buy a
catalogue even at half the cost price of printing but prefer to make
use of the copies provided at the desks. Moreover, at the end of six or
even fewer months after publication the public usually regard it as out
of date and decides to wait for the <em>next</em> edition. In this respect the
classified catalogue has the advantage, as it costs less to print, and
for this reason, as well as owing to the custom of admitting readers
to the shelves of public libraries, there has been a revival of this
style of catalogue in late years, especially as it serves as a key or
guide to the arrangement of the books upon the shelves of "open access"
libraries. It can moreover be printed and issued in sections without
affecting its completeness in the end.</p>

<p>The dictionary form, as distinguished from a mere alphabetical list of
authors, consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of entries of books under their specific subjects,
instead of their classes. To quote Cutter again: "Thus if a book
treats of Natural History it is put under that heading; if it treats
of Zoology alone that word is the rubric; if it is on Mammals it will
be found under mammals; and, finally, if one is looking for a treatise
on the elephant, he need not know if that animal is a mammal; he need
not even be sure that it is an animal; he has merely to be sufficiently
acquainted with his alphabet to find the word Elephant, under which
will appear all the separate works that the library contains on that
subject. Nothing, one would think, can be more simple, easy to explain,
easy and expeditious to use than this. No matter what he wants he will
find it at once provided that the library has a book on just that
subject and that it has been entered under the very word which he is
thinking of. If these conditions are not fulfilled, however, there
is more trouble. If the library has no book or article sufficiently
important to be catalogued on that topic he must look in some more
comprehensive work in which he will find it treated (as the history
of Assyrian art is related in the histories of Art), in which case he
will get no help whatever from any dictionary catalogue yet made, in
finding the general work, he must trust to his own knowledge of the
subject and of ordinary classification to guide him to the including
class, or there may be something to his purpose in less general works
(as books on Iron bridges or Suspension bridges might be better than
nothing to a man who was studying the larger subject Bridges), but in
this case also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> he will very seldom get any assistance from dictionary
catalogues, and must rely entirely upon his previous knowledge of
the possible branches of his subject. Even in those catalogues which
relieve him of this trouble by giving cross-references, he must look
twice, first for his own word and then for the word to which he is
referred from that."</p>

<p>A judicial statement of the merits of both these styles of catalogue is
contained in a paper by Mr. F. T. Barrett, of Glasgow, entitled "The
Alphabetical and Classified Forms of Catalogues compared," printed in
the <cite>Transactions of the Second International Library Conference</cite>,
1897. In the <cite>Library Association Record</cite>, 1901 (pt. 1), pp. 514-531,
there is a verbal and friendly duel between Mr. W. E. Doubleday and the
author upon the matter, mainly from the practical point of view.</p>

<p>The Alphabetico-Classed catalogue, as its name denotes, is an attempt
at a classified catalogue in alphabetical order of subjects or
classes, and is a mixture of the two systems already spoken of, and
about as satisfactory as hybrids usually are. The late Prof. Justin
Winsor characterised it as "the mongrel alphabetico-classed system, a
primarily classed system with an alphabetical graft upon it is a case
of confusion worse confounded." The great difficulty both to compiler
and user is to know where the subjects leave off and the classes
begin&mdash;in other words, whether a subject or a class entry is likely to
be the one wanted. One of the best examples of this kind of catalogue
is the late Mr. Fortescue's "Subject Index to the British Museum
Catalogue," and he apparently experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> the difficulty of deciding,
as for instance a book on the elephant appears under Elephant, but a
work upon the Elk must be looked for under "Deer." The usefulness of
this particular catalogue cannot be gainsaid as its value is too well
known, mainly because there is no other form of subject-catalogue for
the library of the British Museum. Besides it has such a comprehensive
series of cross-references that difficulty is largely obviated, and
then again it is only meant as a subject supplement to the principal
catalogue. Admirable as it is, we may see how it works out in practice.
Suppose we are interested in Law. Under the heading "Law" we find
a large number of entries divided into particular kinds of law as
"Commercial," "Criminal," "Ecclesiastical," &amp;c., and these are further
sub-divided under the names of countries. One would suppose that the
subject would be here treated in a most exhaustive manner. But that is
not so, as if we require books on the Laws of England we must turn to
the word "England." Thus we have books on English criminal law under
"Law"; a book upon English general law under "England"; and a book say
upon English election law under "Elections, Law of." If it is right to
put books on the law of elections under Elections it might be assumed
that books on criminal law would go under "Criminal law," but there
is not even a reference to say where they are to be found. Admittedly
"Law" is a large and complex subject, and would fill many pages if the
books upon it were brought together. As it is the searcher must take
a long time to ascertain in any exhaustive manner what books upon the
subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> are contained in Mr. Fortescue's Indexes. Even if the inquiry
is narrowed down to say Italian law, searches must be made in many
places without touching special Italian law at all. However there is no
system but has its drawbacks, though probably the alphabetico-classed
has the most.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as a dictionary system that combines an unseen
but systematically classified system. Its root method would be to
adopt some thorough scheme of classification permitting of the
finest possible detail in topic and adjust thereto any necessary
cross-references to cover synonymous names and double subjects. The
cataloguer would keep the complete scheme in all its details before him
and, by means of an alphabetical index to every adopted name, he would
have a list of the subject-headings in dictionary order and to these he
would adhere. There would still be specific entry. This is the method
that should be pursued in the compilation of dictionary catalogues.
The classification may exist only in the mind of the cataloguer and
be formulated in no other way unless he relies upon headings already
fixed in his catalogue. By trying to adjust headings in such catalogues
to any logical classification one can soon ascertain whether they are
systematic or haphazard.</p>

<p>The following definitions should be noted before proceeding to the next
chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Author-Catalogue</em> is one in which the entries are arranged
alphabetically according to the names of the authors (a dictionary of
authors).</p>

<p><em>Title-Catalogue</em> is one in which the entries are arranged
alphabetically according to some word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> the title, especially the
first (a dictionary of titles).</p>

<p><em>Subject-Catalogue</em> is one in which the entries are arranged according
to the subjects of the books, alphabetically by the words selected
to denote those subjects (dictionary arrangement). If these subject
entries are not arranged alphabetically, but are formed into classes
philosophically according to the scientific relations of the subjects,
then it is a classed or classified catalogue.</p>

<p><em>Form-Catalogue</em> is one in which the entries are arranged according
to the forms of literature and the languages in which the books are
written, either alphabetically or according to the relations of the
forms to one another.</p>

<p>Apart from these there is a style of catalogue in which the entries are
selected to suit the kind of person for whom the books are designed. A
catalogue of books for children would be of this order. While it would
include books in all classes of literature written to suit juvenile
capacity, yet it may reasonably be regarded as a class in itself, and a
place is usually assigned to it in a classified catalogue.</p>

<p>When a catalogue of a particular class of literature is separately
published it is called a <em>Class-List</em>. A catalogue of novels, or of
poetry, or of music would be so termed.</p>

<p>By the term <em>Dictionary Catalogue</em> we understand a combination of the
first three, viz., Author, Title, and Subject catalogues in a single
alphabet.</p>

<p>The last two forms when thrown together, not in alphabetical but in
logical arrangement, make the <em>Classified Catalogue</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The same two if arranged alphabetically and not logically form
the <em>Alphabetico-Classed Catalogue</em>. With this last form the
author-catalogue could be combined without any disturbance of its
arrangement. It can only be added to the classified as an index or
appendix.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

Single Author Principal-Entry.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Stationery. The Author-Entry. Full Names. Imprint and
Collation. Order of Information Tabulated. Subject-Entry.
Headings. Class-Entry.</p></div>


<p>To study systematically the various codes of cataloguing rules is of
great value to the beginner in the work of cataloguing a library,
though the apparent variations and contradictions in the codes are
at first somewhat confusing. Their practical application to work in
hand serves better to prove the usefulness and necessity of adopting
some code or a modification of it before much progress is made. Once a
choice is made, it is better to adhere to it uniformly throughout.</p>

<p>The purpose of the catalogue has a bearing upon the nature of the
stationery required. A catalogue cannot be written into a book like
an inventory; each item&mdash;even books by the same author or upon the
same subject&mdash;must be upon a separate paper slip or card cut uniformly
to any size fixed upon. Paper slips serve quite well for manuscript,
or "copy" as it is termed, for the printer, but tough cards of good
quality are needed for a catalogue on cards to be handled by many
persons. It is a good plan in any case first to prepare the catalogue
upon slips or cards for office use; then, when checked and revised, to
copy from these for public use, either upon the good quality cards as
suggested, or into the book-form of catalogues with separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> leaves,
known as "sheaf-catalogues." This last-named form is preferable for
public use, and takes up less room. Any size of slips or cards may
be adopted provided they are exactly cut to a fixed size, 5 inches
by 3 inches being convenient; or the size usually provided with the
index filing outfits, now so generally in commercial use, which were
first used in the cataloguing of libraries, and then applied to other
purposes. If the slips or cards are for handwriting, they should be
ruled "feint" across, and whether so written or typed, are better
with red lines marking margins of about half an inch at each side. If
written by hand, the writing should be round, clear, of fair size, and
above all, free from flourishes, whether written for public use or for
the printer.</p>

<p>Two of the first questions a catalogue will be expected to answer are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have you a particular book by a given author?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What books have you by a named author?</span><br />
</p>

<p>These two questions are not precisely identical, though they are both
answered by the same form of catalogue entry, namely, that under the
surname of the writer of the book, known as the "author-entry." This,
or some substitute therefor, is invariably regarded as the main, or
principal, entry. Though the placing or position of such an entry is
not the same in both the dictionary and classified forms of catalogue,
one falling under the author's name according to its place in the
alphabet, and the other into its position in a class, the form of the
entry itself is the same in both. The particulars for this entry must
always be taken from the full title-page of the book, never from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the
binding or from the preliminary or half-title, though at times this
half or "bastard-title" will furnish the name of the series or some
other detail not given elsewhere but wanted for full-entry.</p>

<p>The title-page of the first book we deal with reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 642px;">
<img src="images/illus-034.jpg" width="642" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption bbox"><div class="ph1">IN PORTUGAL</div>
<div class="ph2">BY AUBREY F. G. BELL</div>

<div class="p2">Oh quem f&ocirc;ra a Portugal<br />
Terra que Deus bemdizia!<br />
<div style="margin-left: 12em;"><em>Romance.</em><br /></div>
(O to go to Portugal, land heaven-blest)<br /></div>

<div class="ph3">LONDON: John Lane, The Bodley Head.<br />

<br />NEW YORK: John Lane Company. MCMXII.</div></div>
</div>

<p>The surname of the author then is Bell, and we either enclose his
further names in parentheses, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bell (Aubrey F. G.)</span><br />
</p>

<p>or with a comma and full stop, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bell, Aubrey F. G.</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is no reason for advocating the adoption of one of these
styles more than the other, especially in these days of type-setting
machines. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> hand composition is still in use, and particularly in
small printing offices, the use of a large number of parentheses (&nbsp;)
causes "a run on sorts," that is, the supply wanted is greater than
is ordinarily found with a fount of jobbing type. Nowadays, it being
merely a question of taste, and not one of expediency, it matters
less, and as my personal preference is for the use of the comma and
point, that style is used in the examples given throughout this book.
The form decided upon must be adhered to if only to ensure uniform
appearance&mdash;certainly both forms should not be found in one catalogue.
Attention to details of this kind is the essence of good work, and
after a time cataloguers, becoming accustomed to a particular style,
fall, as a matter of course, into its use quite readily.</p>

<p>The surname is followed, as shown, by the Christian or forenames, but
we are often confronted with the necessity for deciding how much of
these forenames shall go in&mdash;shall they be given as on the title-page,
or shall we find out the full names covered by the initials, or will
initials alone suffice? In some catalogues the full names are given, in
others only the initials, and in a few rare instances of "index-entry"
catalogues the surname alone. For an average catalogue to give the name
in its fullest possible form is more than is required, and is wasteful
of space, while the bare initials do not enable us to discern whether
the author is a man or a woman. It is more helpful to give the first or
other important forename, and to do so does not lengthen the catalogue
to any appreciable extent. The danger of this omission is exemplified
at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>In the catalogues of large libraries it is often necessary to take the
trouble to get all names as fully and correctly as possible, otherwise,
owing to the likelihood of numerous entries under persons with the
same surnames, errors may result if the authors are not distinguished
from one another in this way. This does not imply that the cataloguer
of a collection of books up to 100,000 volumes need go to the trouble
of giving every name in full as if he were compiling a biographical
dictionary; nor need he add the dates of the author's birth and
death to the name, as is sometimes done, because the labour will be
unappreciated, and be wasted. Such dates, however, have at times to be
given to distinguish between authors whose names are alike.</p>

<p>It is a wise plan, in any case, to limit the forenames or initials to
those <em>used</em> by an author on his books at any time during his career.
For all reasonable purposes, or any purpose, Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
for example, is sufficient, though his name was properly Gabriel
Charles Dante Rossetti, Charles Dickens, instead of Charles John Huffam
Dickens, will not be mistaken for any other of the name, and Joaquin
Miller will serve better than Cincinnatus Heine Miller.</p>

<p>A few instances taken from recent books by well-known authors will show
how difficulties may arise in this connection. George Bernard Shaw's
"Man and Superman" according to the title-page is "by Bernard Shaw,"
whereas his "The quintessence of Ibsenism" is "by G. Bernard Shaw."
Martin Hume's work on "The love affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots" is
given as "by Martin Hume," but his "Spain: its greatness and decay" is
"by Martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> A. S. Hume." There is the "Life of Gladstone" "by Herbert
Woodfield Paul," a book "Men and letters" "by Herbert Paul," and
"Matthew Arnold" (in the "English Men of Letters" series), "by Herbert
W. Paul." Then we have the case of the well-known writer on animal life
who changed his name recently on his books from Ernest Seton Thompson
to Ernest Thompson Seton. This leads the unwary cataloguer into the
mistake of getting books by the same author under different names. It
must be confessed that the risk is not great where such well-known
writers are concerned, but if they should be unknown authors of a
past age or another country, the cataloguer would probably not be so
well-informed, and fall into error. To cite an instance of this, the
French author, Louis Jacques Napoleon Bertrand, we are told, took the
name of Ludovic Bertrand, and later substituted Aloysius for Ludovic,
the wonder being that he did not change the Bertrand also. There is
need to be constantly on the alert for those who have no fixity of
name. The only little satisfaction the cataloguer has if he finds he
has tripped is that few will have sufficient knowledge to discover his
fault.</p>

<p>Besides the catalogues of important libraries, the following may be
named as among the more useful works of reference for working out the
names of authors and other personages:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Phillips</span>, Lawrence B. The dictionary of biographical</span><br />

</p>

<p>The <cite>New York State University Library Bulletin, Bibliography</cite>, No.
5, issued in 1898 at the price of 3d., consists of "A selection of
Reference Books for the use of Cataloguers in finding Full Names."</p>

<p>To revert to the book we are dealing with. As the author gives his
first Christian name in full and two initials for the others we may
regard it as quite full enough for any style of catalogue, and adding
the title of the book, the entry becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bell</span>, Aubrey F. G.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In Portugal.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The quotation on the title-page, with its translation, is ignored
altogether, as would be anything of a similar nature, such as a motto;
these are merely adornments of the title-page, and have no bearing
whatever upon the book from the cataloguer's standpoint. If it were
intended to be very exact the omission could be indicated by three dots
(...) but the need for doing this only applies in the case of rare or
special editions.</p>

<p>We have now got the first two parts of our catalogue entry, and in the
order from which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> can be no deviation. Our next step is to decide
how much further information is to be given. A catalogue of a library
has been defined as a list of the titles of books which it contains,
and that it (the catalogue) must not be expected to give any further
description of a book than the author gives, or ought to give, on the
title-page, and the publisher in the imprint, or colophon.</p>

<p>The catalogue can be made to give, besides the titles of books, such
descriptions, more or less extended, drawn from all available sources
of information, as may be necessary to furnish means of identifying
each work, of distinguishing its different editions, of ascertaining
the requisites of a perfect copy, of learning all facts of interest
respecting its authorship, publication, typography, subsequent
causalities, alterations, etc., its market value, and the estimation in
which it is held.</p>

<p>For our entry we shall adopt the happy mean between these two and
add to this entry, because it is the principal one, the information
contained in the "imprint" at the foot of the title-page, giving the
place of publication, the publisher's (or printer's) name, and the
date of publication. In the early days of printing this information
was given at the end of a book, and termed the "colophon." We shall
also give the information spoken of as "the collation," consisting
of a statement of the number of pages in the book, whether it is
illustrated, and how, by maps, portraits, or otherwise, and even if the
illustrations are in colour.</p>

<p>The first-named place of publication on the title-page of the book
is London. In the catalogues of British libraries it is a recognised
custom to omit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> naming the place of publication when a book is
unmistakably published in London, this being taken as understood, all
other places being given. Except in booksellers' lists and similar
catalogues, the name of the publisher may also be left out, though
it is often given in the full form of library catalogues. In the
case of this book, the name of the second place, New York, is merely
supplemental, the book being printed as well as published in this
country. The date of publication must always be given, and in every
entry (with the single exception of works of fiction, referred to
later), not in Roman numerals, however, but in Arabic.</p>

<p>When books are in a number of volumes, the earliest and latest dates
are given. These dates are not necessarily those of the first and last
volumes, as the volumes may not have appeared in regular sequence, or a
set may be made up from editions of varying dates.</p>

<p>For "the collation" we carefully examine the book and find that
it has eight pages of prefatory matter marked with Roman numerals
(i.&mdash;viii.), and the body of the work contains 227, paged in Arabic.
This is shown as pp. viii. + 227, or as pp. viii., 227. The book has
no map or illustrations. The enumeration of the pages in this way, it
may be said, conveys no very exact idea of the extent of the work, as,
of course, large type requires many more pages than small. Even the
thickness of the book is not indicated by stating the number of pages,
as an India-paper edition will contain just the same number of pages as
one on thick paper. For these and other reasons, such information can
be omitted if economy of space is of any conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>quence. If a book is in
more than one volume it is unusual to give the number of pages, though
it is sometimes done in publishers' lists. A "book" is invariably
understood to mean a complete work, whether in one or many volumes.</p>

<p>The size of the book may also be given, and will occasionally prove
useful, while completing the entry. The book we are dealing with is
octavo in size, coming between the sizes known as "crown" and "demy,"
but as these terms convey no special idea to the uninformed in book
sizes, and, indeed, no very definite idea to those who are, it will
suffice for most purposes to call the book 8<sup>o</sup> (octavo) unless the
height is given instead in inches or in centimetres, as 8&frac14;in. or 21cm.
For most catalogues it will be found sufficient to give the sizes
when they exceed octavo, it being understood that all books are of
that size, or less, unless the contrary is indicated by the signs
4<sup>o</sup>(quarto) or f<sup>o</sup> (folio).</p>

<p>The entry completed upon these lines becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bell</span>, Aubrey F. G.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In Portugal. <em>London and New York</em>, John</span><br />

</p>

<p>The information to be given, when tabulated, falls into this order</p>


<ol><li>&mdash;Author's surname.</li>
<li>&mdash;The author's forenames.</li>
<li>&mdash;The title of the book.</li>

<p>Numbers 4, 5, 6, 12, and 13 are not required or given in the above
entry, but are here inserted to make the table complete. With the
exception of numbers 1 to 4, this order may be varied at will, but only
at the outset, as whatever order is decided upon must afterwards be
adhered to. The following statement of the order given in some of the
rules is of interest in this connection, and will be helpful:&mdash;</p>

<p>For most libraries the information can be satisfactorily curtailed and
limited to the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1, Author. 2, Title. 3, Edition. 4, Date. 5, Press mark. 6,
Contents or annotations. To these may be added, between 3 and
4, an abbreviation telling if the book is illustrated, as
"illus.", instead of giving the collation in full.</p></div>

<p>The reduced entry for our book accordingly becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bell</span>, Aubrey F. G.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In Portugal. 1912</span><br />
</p>

<p>Having the author or principal entry complete, we now proceed to
examine the book for subject-entry, and find that it consists of
descriptions of journeys to places off the beaten track in Portugal.
Even with the title of the book so obvious and the subject so clearly
named in it, it is wise not to take it for granted, and examine
the book as it may contain something of value belonging to another
subject&mdash;for example, there is a book of travel in the Near East
bearing the title "Pen and pencil in Asia Minor" which contains no less
than thirteen chapters upon silkworms and the silk industry, not only
in the Levant, but in France and elsewhere&mdash;quite a respectable book
within a book, but this the title-page fails to reveal. The subject
of our book, however, is open to no doubt, and for the dictionary
catalogue the subject-entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Portugal</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bell, A. F. G. In Portugal. 1912</span><br />
</p>

<p>No further entries are called for than these two (author and subject).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In all entries subordinate to the main entry, where the fullest
particulars concerning the book are given, the information is condensed
sufficiently to identify the book upon the supposition that those
who require more details will turn to the main entry for them. The
omissions from the subordinate entries are the full Christian names
of authors (initials alone being given), the names of editors,
translators, or illustrators, the names of series, the collations,
sizes, and places of publication. The entries used throughout this work
demonstrate this. The dates of publications are invariably given in all
entries except where shown.</p>

<p>It has been contended that all details are as much wanted under the
subject as under the author. There is much to be said in favour of
this, but it is impossible to make every entry a main-entry when
expense and the size of the catalogue have to be considered.</p>

<p>When the time comes for preparing the manuscript of the catalogue for
the press, should it happen that there was no other book upon the
subject, then the form of entry can be changed to what may be called a
subject-title-entry, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portugal, In. Bell, A. F. G. 1912</span><br />
</p>

<p>upon the principle that a "heading" is not required unless there are
two or more books to go under it. By the reverse process, if there
should be two or more title-entries of books unquestionably upon the
same subject then these are converted into entries under a single
subject-heading. If the two entries were</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portugal, In. Bell, A. F. G. 1912</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portugal, Sunshine and storm in. Watson, G. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>they are changed to</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Portugal</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bell, A. F. G. In Portugal. 1912</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Watson, G. Sunshine and storm in Portugal. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is possible further to economise these entries:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Portugal</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bell, A. F. G. In P. 1912</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Watson, G. Sunshine, etc. in P. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p>This style was adopted in quite good catalogues, and there is no
particular loss of information through it, though the gain of space
hardly compensates for the want of clearness, to say nothing of the
somewhat bald appearance of the entries.</p>

<p>In all the subject-entries above it will be observed that the author's
surname leads, the reason for this being that it serves to guide
to the name under which the main-entry is to be found. The books
are also arranged in alphabetical order by these surnames under the
subject-heading.</p>

<p>If the catalogue we are compiling is not dictionary but classified in
its arrangement, then, as already stated, there is but one entry (other
than the brief index entries), and that the main-entry. Upon this is
marked the numerical symbols of the classification adopted, which we
shall presume throughout is the best-known and most used, Dewey's
<cite>Decimal Classification</cite>. For convenience in sorting, the numbers are
better written on the top right-hand of the slip or card. Our entry is
marked accordingly</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 31em;"><strong>914.69</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bell</span>, Aubrey F. G. In Portugal. <em>London and</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>New York</em>, John Lane, 1912. pp. viii., 227. 8<sup>o</sup></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>This entry can be curtailed if considered desirable, as shown above for
the dictionary catalogue.</p>

<p>As some persons may not have used the Dewey Classification, it may be
explained that these numerical symbols signify</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Dewey Classification">
  <tr>
    <td>900</td>
    <td>History (the General Class).</td>

    <td>Spain (the Iberian Peninsula).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>914.69</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Brief entries are needed for the author and subject-index or indexes,
which appear at either the end or beginning of the catalogue when
printed, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bell, A. F. G. In Portugal. 914.69</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portugal (Travels). 914.69</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the following pages all the examples given to illustrate the various
points which arise in the cataloguing of books are worked out in full
for both the dictionary and classified catalogues, in order to show the
whole method of treatment, as well as to prevent the misunderstanding
which arose upon explanations given only by way of suggestion, and not
as completed examples, in my former book upon this subject.</p>

<p>To show how difficult it is for experienced cataloguers to avoid
error and the pitfalls in their way, it may be mentioned that several
otherwise good catalogues have these two books</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here and there in Italy and over the border, by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Linda Villari. 1893</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Italian life in town and country, by L. Villari. 1902</span><br />
</p>

<p>entered as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Villari</span>, Linda. Here and there in Italy. 1893</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Italian life in town and country. 1902</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>though the latter book is by Luigi Villari. With nothing in either
book to show this, the presumption that both books are by the same
author is excusable, the initials of the authors' names and the subject
being alike, yet it proves that it does not do to jump to conclusions.
Correctly catalogued, the entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Villari</span>, Linda. Here and there in Italy and over</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">the border. pp. viii., 269. 1893</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Villari</span>, Luigi. Italian life in town and country.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(<em>Our neighbours.</em>) pp. xii., 261, illus. 1902</span><br />
</p>

<p>and the subject-entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Italy.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Villari, L. Here and there in Italy. 1893</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Villari, L. Italian life in town and country. 1902</span><br />
</p>

<p>Both entries will be marked 914.5 for the classified catalogue
(History&mdash;Geography and Travels&mdash;Europe&mdash;Italy), and the index entries
will be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Villari, Linda. Here and there in Italy. 914.5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Villari, Luigi. Italian life. 914.5</span><br />

<p>When a book is written by two authors, the entry is given under the
first-named on the title-page. The following is an illustration of the
method of treatment in such a case, and in order to make the matter
clear, the title-page is set out in full as before. The whole title
is printed in capital letters, and has no other punctuation than that
shown.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></div>

<p>Upon the lines already laid down, the main-entry becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ely</span>, Richard T., and George Ray <span class="smcap">Wicker</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Elementary principles of economics; together</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">with a short sketch of economic history. <em>New</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>York</em>, Macmillan Co., 1910. pp. xii., 388</span><br />
</p>

<p>Frequently the names of the authors are seen rendered in this fashion</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ely</span>, Richard T., and <span class="smcap">Wicker</span>, George Ray</span><br />
</p>

<p>While it is essential and unavoidable that the name of the first author
should be turned about to get his surname as the leading word, yet
there is no object in twisting about the second author's name in like
manner, as it is not so required, therefore the ordinary reading of the
name is better and simpler, as given in the first entry.</p>

<p>Unless needed to distinguish between different authors of the same
name, the academical degrees are omitted, as well as any statement
concerning the professorships held by these authors, although the fact
that they hold such offices goes to prove their qualifications for
dealing with this subject. If it were desired to direct attention to
this, it could be done by means of a note or annotation to the entry,
after this manner</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first author is Prof. of Pol. Econ., Wisconsin Univ., and
the second Asst. Prof. of Economics, Dartmouth Coll.</p></div>

<p>The share of the second author in the book needs to be recognised, and
this is accomplished by means of a reference, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wicker</span>, George Ray (<em>Joint-Author.</em>) <em>See</em> Ely,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Richard T.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>If this writer happens to be the sole author of another work, then the
form of reference is made to read</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wicker</span>, George Ray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; (<em>Joint-Author</em>). <em>See also</em> Ely, Richard T.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To give the reference in this form may seem to be a contradiction of
the previous statement that the second author's name need not be turned
about, but in this case it is necessary to point directly to the name
Ely under which the entry is found.</p>

<p>An alternative style for both the above references so far as the use of
capitals and punctuation is concerned is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wicker</span>, Geo. Ray (<em>joint-author</em>) <em>see</em> <span class="smcap">Ely</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Richard T.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wicker</span>, Geo. Ray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; (<em>joint-author</em>) <em>see also</em> Ely, Richard T.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that whatever style is adopted should be
strictly followed throughout.</p>

<p>An explanation concerning the collation (number of pages) is required.
The book has six prefatory leaves, paged in Roman numerals, i. to xi.,
made up of the half-title and the title (both unpaged), three pages
of preface (the second and third being marked vi., vii.), a blank
page, three pages with a list of contents (the second and third are
marked x., xi.), and a blank page, making twelve pages in all. Doubt
will arise in a case of this kind as to whether the title leaves and
the blank pages should be taken into account, but as the printer has
seen fit to include them all in his pagination, the statement of these
prefatory pages is better given as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> xii. The rest of the book is
straightforward, being paged from 1 to 388.</p>

<p>A briefer form of author-entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ely, R. T.</span>, and <span class="smcap">G. R. Wicker</span>. Elementary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">principles of economics; with a short sketch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of economic history. <em>N.Y.</em>, 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>The places of publication may be shortened in this way where the
abbreviation used can be readily recognised&mdash;N.Y. for New York.
Examples of other places will readily occur to the cataloguer,
especially if they are in common use, as <em>Edin.</em> for Edinburgh, <em>Dub.</em>
for Dublin, <em>Oxf.</em> for Oxford, <em>Camb.</em> for Cambridge, <em>Manc.</em> for
Manchester, <em>L'pool</em> for Liverpool, and so on. The London Library
Catalogue goes much further than this, and gives <em>A.</em> for Amsterdam,
<em>C.</em> for Cambridge, <em>D.</em> for Dublin, <em>L.</em> for Leipzig, and other bare
initials in the same way, though they are not consistently used.
It not only omits London as the place of publication from English
books, as already recommended herein, but carries out the idea to the
exclusion of all capital cities in the cases of native published books,
leaving Paris, Berlin, Madrid, to be taken as understood when these
cities are the places of publication of French, German, and Spanish
books respectively. In many ways the economies effected in the London
Library Catalogue are notable, though so numerous that a considerable
explanatory list has to be given in the preface. The book we are
dealing with would appear in this style in the Author Catalogue</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Ely (Richard Theodore) &amp; G. R. Wicker.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Elem. princ. of economics, w. a short sketch of econ.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">hist. s8<sup>o</sup> N.Y. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>and in the Subject Index would be further condensed. The shortest form
allowable in the catalogue of a popular library, without abbreviating
the words, is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ely</span>, R. T., and G. R. <span class="smcap">Wicker</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Elementary principles of economics. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>In considering the subject-heading for this book, we have the choice
of synonymous terms, viz., Economics and Political Economy. The first
is the more modern term which is gradually supplanting the other in
use, and for that reason it is the better to adopt. Having made the
choice definitely, we at once proceed to write a cross-reference, which
will prevent the placing of any other book upon the same subject under
the discarded heading whatever be the terms on the title-page. The
reader will be thus guided to the heading which has been chosen for the
subject. It is a fundamental principle of the dictionary catalogue,
which cannot be too often impressed upon the cataloguer, that a book is
entered under its specific subject quite irrespective of the terms used
upon the title-page, and that two books upon the same subject ought not
to be in two places. Accordingly the reference to this end will be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Political Economy. <em>See</em> Economics.</span><br />
</p>

<p>which prevents the placing of any book under Political Economy.</p>

<p>The subject-entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Economics</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ely, R. T., &amp;c. Elementary principles of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">economics. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the economies in <em>subordinate entries</em> already referred to, it
will be seen that the second author's name has "etc." substituted for
it; as a well-recognised further economy that may be adopted without
hesitation.</p>

<p>No other entries of any kind are needed for the dictionary catalogue,
as the book is adequately catalogued as shown.</p>

<p>For the classified catalogue, the author-entry is marked 330.2 (300
Sociology, 330 Political Economy, 330.2 Compends), and the entries for
the indexes are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Economics 330</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Political Economy 330</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ely, R. T., &amp;c. Elem. economics 330.2</span><br />
</p>

<p>The writers of a published correspondence are regarded as joint-authors
in the same way, except that a book like</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The correspondence of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Waldo Emerson, 1834-1872. 2 v. ports. 1883</span><br />
</p>

<p>cannot be covered very satisfactorily by an entry under the first-named
and a reference under the second, as in the Ely-Wicker above, such a
book needing two entries. An examination of it shows that the letters
were edited by Charles Eliot Norton, and, though this is not stated
on the title-page, it goes into the principal entry, but between
brackets (not parentheses), which, as Cutter says in his Rules, are
important, "both as a check on indiscriminate addition and as an aid to
identification." The main-entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>, Thomas, and Ralph Waldo <span class="smcap">Emerson</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Correspondence, 1834-72; [ed. by Charles</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Eliot Norton.] 2 v. ports. 1883</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>and the second entry under</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Emerson</span>, Ralph Waldo, and Thomas <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Correspondence, 1834-72. 2 v. 1883</span><br />
</p>

<p>A reference is required under the editor's name, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Norton</span>, Charles E. (<em>Ed.</em>) <em>See</em> Carlyle, Thomas.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Most catalogues will have a goodly number of entries under Carlyle.
To enlarge the reference sufficiently to describe the particular book
involves a reference as long as an entry. In such case give the entry</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Norton</span>, Charles E. (<em>Ed.</em>) Correspondence of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thomas Carlyle and Ralph W. Emerson. 2 v.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1883</span><br />
</p>

<p>or, shorter still,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Norton</span>, Chas. E. (<em>Ed.</em>) Correspondence of Carlyle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and Emerson. 2 v. 1883</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is better than a reference, as it takes up no more room and saves
the searcher the trouble of turning to another part of the catalogue. A
book of this kind, obviously, has no subject-entry.</p>

<p>In the classified catalogue a dual book like this needs two
entries&mdash;one in 816.3 (American Letters) for Emerson, and another in
826.8 (English Letters) for Carlyle, with the index entries</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Carlyle, Thos. Correspondence with Emerson, 826.8</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Emerson, R. W. Correspondence with Carlyle, 816.3</span><br />
</p>

<p>The book itself cannot go under both these numbers on the shelves;
choice of one must be made, preferably the Carlyle number, though this
does not affect the entries in the catalogue except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> so far as the
necessary clue to the position of the book for finding is concerned.</p>

<p>A somewhat exceptional example of joint-authors, fortunately for the
cataloguer, is that of a man and wife whose names appear on their
books sometimes with the one leading, sometimes the other. This is to
be found in the books by the mountaineers and explorers Mr. and Mrs.
Workman, two of whose books may be taken to illustrate the matter, and
catalogued as they would be under ordinary circumstances, viz.,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Workman</span>, William Hunter and Fanny Bullock.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Through town and jungle: fourteen thousand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">miles awheel among the temples and people</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of the Indian Plain. 1904. pp. xxiv., 380,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">map, illus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Workman</span>, Fanny Bullock and William Hunter.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In the ice world of Him&aacute;laya: among the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">peaks and passes of Ladakh, Nubra, Suru,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and Baltistan. 1900. pp. xvi., 204, maps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">illus.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Owing to the names being reversed, these entries would not come
together in the catalogue, so the cataloguer is quite justified in
stretching the meaning of the rules in order to avoid their separation.
The name that appears first in the majority of the books by the two
authors is adopted for the entry, which in this case is the lady.
Accordingly the first book will be brought under the second form of
the names, and other books they have written conjointly will be so
entered, that all of them may come together. In order to prevent
misunderstanding, and lest the second name be read as Hunter, the names
can be shortened, as</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Workman</span>, Fanny B. and Wm. H. In the ice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">world of Him&aacute;laya: among the peaks and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">passes of Ladakh, Nubra, Suru, and Baltistan.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1900. pp. xvi., 204, maps, illus.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Plain. 1904. pp. xxiv., 380, map, illus.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is allowable to interpret "fourteen thousand" as 14,000, in the
middle of a title, as above; if the title commenced with it, the words
are better.</p>

<p>Although the separate names of these authors may come together in the
catalogue, it is better not to anticipate that they will, so it is
safer to give the necessary reference&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Workman</span>, William H. (<em>joint-author</em>.) <em>See</em> Workman,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fanny B.</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the time of printing this reference may be omitted if it is found
that no other name comes between, though the reference stands if the
rules are literally followed.</p>

<p>For the first of these two books the subject-entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Himalayas, The</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Workman, F. B., &amp;c. In the ice world of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Him&aacute;laya. 1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>and two references will be desirable and necessary,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>India</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Himalayas.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Mountaineering</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Himalayas.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The first of these will insure that a person requiring books upon
India in all parts will not overlook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> those upon the Himalayas, and
the second will show that books upon mountain climbing in particular
regions are entered under the names of those regions.</p>

<p>As the journey chronicled in the second of these books covered the
length and breadth of India, it is entered under the name of the
country accordingly, and placed in that sub-division of the subject
allotted to books of travel.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>India</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;"><em>Travels and Description.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Workman, F. B., &amp;c. Through town and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">jungle. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p>Any subject-heading comprising a comparatively large number of books is
better sub-divided, as it not only facilitates reference, but in a way
indicates the character of the books.</p>

<p>Here again title-entries under "In" or "Through" would be useless and
wasteful.</p>

<p>For the classified catalogue the first of these books is marked 915.42
(History, Geography and Travels, Asia, India, North-west Provinces,
etc.), and the second 915.4 (Travels in India generally). The
index-entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Workman, F. B., &amp;c. Ice world of Him&aacute;laya. 915.42.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Through town and jungle. 915.4</span><br />

<p>A book written by more than two authors or of a composite character
needs careful consideration as to the best method of entry. If the
number of authors does not exceed three, the book can be dealt with on
the lines indicated in the preceding chapter. The principal entry of a
book of this nature is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Cadbury</span>, Edward, M. C&eacute;cile <span class="smcap">Matheson</span>, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">George <span class="smcap">Shann</span>. Women's work and wages:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">a phase of life in an industrial city. 1906</span><br />
</p>

<p>The method of giving the imprint and collation having already been
shown, they are omitted as far as they can be from this and all
subsequent entries taken in illustration, upon the understanding
that those who desire to give them in full know how to do so, and
others&mdash;the majority&mdash;who look upon them as burdening the entry, can
see how far they may be judiciously left out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The second and third authors of the above book require references from
their names</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Matheson</span>, M. C&eacute;cile (<em>joint-author</em>.) <em>See</em> Cadbury,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Edward.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Shann</span>, George (<em>joint-author</em>.) <em>See</em> Cadbury,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Edward.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Where strict economy of entry is of importance, these two references
could be dispensed with, though it is undesirable to omit them if space
can be spared. The economy can, of course, be carried much further by
laying down a rule to the effect that, when a book has more than two
authors, only the first shall be taken into account, in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Cadbury</span>, Edward, and others. Women's work</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and wages. 1906</span><br />
</p>

<p>in which case the references cannot be given, as there is nothing to
refer to, the names of the other authors not appearing in the entry.
Some catalogues economise by leaving out all references from the names
of joint-authors without any serious difficulty arising, though it is
not in accordance with good cataloguing principles.</p>

<p>An alternative method of entry, and one recognised by the rules, though
it is cumbersome, is to take the name of the first-mentioned author as
the "heading," followed by "and others," and bring the names of all
into the entry, after this fashion</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Cadbury</span>, Edward, and others. Women's work</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and wages: a phase of life in an industrial</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">city, by Edward Cadbury, M. C&eacute;cile Matheson,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and George Shann. 1906</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>the references ("added entries") from the two last-named authors being
given as recommended above.</p>

<p>This book requires two subject-entries and a reference, it being upon
women's work and the payment therefor among the poorer class of workers
in Birmingham, and is a contribution to the literature of the labour
question as regards women. Therefore it is entered under the heading
"Labour," with a sub-heading "Women's work."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Labour</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;"><em>Women's work.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Cadbury, E., &amp;c. Women's work and wages.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1906</span><br />
</p>

<p>We have the choice of another heading, viz., "Women"; and as there will
certainly be other books in a reasonably sized library upon the labour
and wages aspects of the question, it would be a waste of space to give
double entries (under both headings), therefore we proceed to put the
matter right by a reference&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Women</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Labour (Women's work).</span><br />
</p>

<p>If we consider that the book has some bearing, as this has, upon the
social question in general, sweating, and poverty, we add <em>See also</em>
references <em>under</em> any headings adopted for these subjects.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Social Question, The</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Labour.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Sweating</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Labour.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Poor</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Labour.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>When the time for printing arrives, if the completed catalogue has no
books entered under any of these headings, the <em>See also</em> reference
must either be withdrawn altogether or converted into a <em>See</em>
reference. For example, the reference from "Sweating" might be given as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sweating. <em>See</em> Labour.</span><br />
</p>

<p>upon the supposition that books solely upon this aspect of the labour
question might be better placed under the more general heading, though
this is somewhat against the rule for specific entry. The difference
between these two forms of reference may again be emphasised. The
<em>See</em> reference is intended to prevent books being entered under the
subject-heading referred <em>from</em> in order that they be placed under the
heading referred <em>to</em>; the <em>See also</em> reference is an appendix to a
subject-heading, under which books relating to the subject in general
are entered, and is meant to direct to lesser or related divisions of
the same subject.</p>

<p>The scope of the inquiry of the book is local and has an important
bearing upon social conditions in Birmingham, which must be taken into
account, therefore an entry is given</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Birmingham</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><em>Social, &amp;c. Conditions.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Cadbury, E., &amp;c. Women's work and wages.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1906</span><br />
</p>

<p>The fact that the book is so entered signifies in itself that it
applies particularly to Birmingham, without any further necessity for
showing the connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>In the classified catalogue the book is placed at 331.4 (Sociology.
Capital. Labour and Wages. Labour of Women), and the index entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cadbury, E., &amp;c. Women's work. 331.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Labour, 331.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Women's work, 331.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Birmingham, Women's work, 331.4</span><br />
</p>

<p>The next book we take in hand has the names of no less than
twenty-three contributors on its title-page, and is entitled</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Church and life of to-day, by the Bishop of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bristol, the Dean of Manchester, the Bishop</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of Durham [and twenty other names following.]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>Clearly all the names cannot be reckoned with in this case, and so we
take the first, the Bishop of Bristol. Under no circumstances would
the book be entered by the name of the See or Deanery of any of the
writers, and, if not given in the book, the name of the Bishop or Dean
must be ascertained from a Clergy List or any other available source,
taking care that the name is that of the right person. Accordingly the
entry under the surname of the first-named author becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Browne</span>, G. F., <em>Bp. of Bristol</em>, and others. The</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Church and life of to-day. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>The <em>Bp. of Bristol</em> may be curtailed to simple <em>Bp.</em>, as bishops
change their sees at times, and it must be a rare occurrence to have
two bishops of the same surname at the same date. It is the rule
to give the highest position attained at the time the catalogue is
prepared, irrespective of the date of publication of the book, even
though it may appear to be an anachronism. This, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> applies
not only to ecclesiastical preferment, but to changes in the peerage
or any other accessions in rank. The second essay in this volume
illustrates this point, though not so far as this book is concerned. It
is by "the Rt. Rev. J. E. Welldon, Dean of Manchester, late Bishop of
Calcutta." The cataloguer does not trouble to notice both offices, but
takes the highest which has been held, and enters as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Welldon, J. E. C.</span>, <em>Bp.</em></span><br />
</p>

<p>While the rules recommend reference from the name of the See, it serves
no very useful purpose, and would multiply entries largely if always
given. The form when used would be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bristol, Bishop of. <em>See</em> Browne, G. F.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the offices held by a writer and his
academical or other honours are ignored by the cataloguer unless for
the special purpose of distinguishing between authors of the same name.
If the title is so used, it is given as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Smith</span>, <em>Rev.</em> John.</span><br />
</p>

<p>if the degree, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Smith</span>, John, <span class="smcap">M.A.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>and not in the form occasionally seen, of</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Smith</span>, M.A., John.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Anything required to distinguish between authors may be used, even the
name of the place with which a man is identified. A good example of
four authors, sometimes mixed for want of this, is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, Isaac, <em>Baptist minister, Calne</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, Isaac, <em>Canon of York</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, Isaac, <em>Indep. minister, Ongar</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Taylor</span>, Isaac, <em>of Stanford Stevens</em>.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>As three of these are "Rev.," no purpose is served by affixing that
title to their names, and in cataloguing would generally be no more
useful than to attach "Mr." to others. It is considered to be quite in
order to ignore all ecclesiastical titles below that of a dean, and,
in the democracy of cataloguing, military and civil distinctions share
the same fate. It is a matter of no moment to the cataloguer that the
compiler say of a dictionary of quotations holds the rank of colonel.
Civil distinctions below that of a knight may safely be disregarded,
even "Hon." omitted from the names of younger sons and daughters of
the nobility, though it is customary and better to give the higher
<em>courtesy titles</em> of Lord and Lady. The custom here outlined works
quite satisfactorily in practice, and is economical of space, but any
who wish to be particularly exact and deferential in this respect
cannot do better than follow the British Museum rule (No. 15) in its
entirety and after the manner of the examples attached thereto.</p>

<p>The honours lists of each New Year and King's Birthday must be closely
examined, and the changes in titles noted for alteration in the
catalogue.</p>

<p>Something must be said here as to the use of capital letters in
cataloguing. Until comparatively recent years it was the recognised
custom to give a capital initial to every word that would admit of it,
but this fashion is not now so generally observed. Perhaps our American
cousins are to be blamed (or praised) for this. As has been truly said</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The reasons for writing and printing all catalogue titles in
small letters and with only such capitals as cannot be avoided
is two-fold. First,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> there can be no standard prescribing what
words should or should not be capitalised [that is, a rule
saying what words should have a capital letter under the older
fashion], and so the cataloguer will be constantly at a loss,
or will use capitals in the most unprincipled way. He will
write one day, The Dangers of great Cities, and the next, The
dangers of Great Cities; with no particular reason for either
form. Secondly, the appearance&mdash;the symmetry&mdash;of a title or a
sentence, whether written or printed, is best attained by the
exclusion of capitals. Nothing can be more unsightly than the
constant breaking up of the harmony of a line by the capricious
use of capitals."</p></div>

<p>The use of capitals is now mostly limited to proper names and to
adjectives derived from them, besides those customary in ordinary
usage. In foreign names the custom of the language is followed, and,
therefore, speaking generally, there would be more capital letters in
the Teutonic languages, and fewer in the Romance languages. In the
entry of the book under notice it is seen that the word Church has
an initial capital because the Church of England is meant and not
the Christian church in general. There is a recommendation to the
effect that a capital initial should be used to the second word in
the title of a book if the first word is an article, and this, though
not commonly adopted in practice, has the advantage of emphasising
the word whereby the entry is usually alphabetised (as shown later),
as the articles "a," "an," and "the," are invariably ignored for this
purpose when beginning a title, though they are taken into account in
the middle of a title. The use made of capital letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> throughout the
illustrative entries in this book is that becoming general, and can
be noted in passing. It is not intended to dogmatise on the use of
capitals, as it resolves itself into a question of taste rather than
one of utility&mdash;the rule is, however, "in all doubtful cases avoid the
use of capitals."</p>

<p>The twenty-three essays or articles in the book before us range over
as many topics, opening with one on novels and novelists, and closing
with one on training in patriotism. As there is a more or less single
purpose or idea running through them all, viz., the influence or
bearing of the Church of England on the ethical and social questions of
the day, the whole book is entered under the name of that Church for
subject.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Church of England</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Browne, G. F., &amp;c. The Church and life of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">to-day. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>As already stated, when the number of entries under such a
subject-heading warrant it, they should be sub-divided to facilitate
reference and indicate as far as possible the nature of the books. As
a rule such divisions suggest themselves by the quantity and nature of
the material in hand when arranging it under the heading, the entries
falling into sections like History, Customs, Ritual, Polity, etc., this
being marked and placed with the sub-division most appropriate.</p>

<p>The book also has a large bearing upon the ethics of these days, and
seems to need an additional entry under "Morals" or "Ethics." If any
doubt exists as to the value of the book as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> contribution to the
subject, let the mistake be made on the right side, and give the entry</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Ethics</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Browne, G. F., &amp;c. The Church and life of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">to-day. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>and the reference from the synonym</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Morals. <em>See</em> Ethics.</span><br />
</p>

<p>For the classified catalogue the entry is marked 261.4 (Religion. The
Church. Church and Morals.), and the index entries</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ethics, Church and, 261.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Church of England and Morals, 261.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Morals, Church and, 261.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Browne, G. F., &amp;c. The Church and life of to-day. 261.4</span><br />
</p>

<p>A book somewhat similar to the last but varying in the method of
treatment is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The citizen of to-morrow: a handbook on social</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">questions edited by Samuel E. Keeble for the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wesleyan Methodist Union for Social Service.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">London, Charles H. Kelly</span><br />
</p>

<p>Examining the book we find that there are three series, each consisting
of five essays, classified as "Historical and General," "Labour and
Poverty," and "Citizenship and Service." The book, having a general
editor, the main-entry is given under his name, and because of this
is not entered under that of the writer of the first essay, as in the
previous example.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Keeble</span>, Samuel E. (<em>Ed.</em>) The citizen of to-morrow:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">a handbook on social questions.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(<em>Wesleyan Methodist Union for Social Service.</em>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[1906]</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The abbreviation <em>Ed.</em> may be used either for editor or edited, the
position marking the meaning. The year of publication is not on the
title-page, but is taken from the end of the preface, which is dated
"June 30, 1906"; being, therefore, an addition to the title-page it
is enclosed in brackets. The value of giving the year of publication
wherever possible is unquestionable. When there is no clue to it in the
book itself, all available sources of reference should be searched,
more particularly the <cite>English Catalogue of Books</cite> and library
catalogues. In the event of the search proving fruitless, the letters
"n.d.", signifying no date, are put in place of the date.</p>

<p>As was the case with the previous book, each essay in the book deals
with a separate subject, yet the whole forms a single subject, and may
be fitly placed under a heading entitled, say,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Social Question, The</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Keeble, S. E. (<em>Ed.</em>) The citizen of to-morrow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[1906]</span><br />
</p>

<p>Such a heading would be specially reserved for books dealing with the
whole social problem, and no book should find a place under it if upon
a particular phase, such as housing, the land, unemployment, etc.,
as the position for these is under the name of the special subject
they deal with. As recommended already, <em>See also</em> references should
be given from it as books upon the separate subjects come up for
cataloguing.</p>

<p>The book is unlike that upon the Church of England, inasmuch as it
lays no particular stress upon the efforts of the Wesleyan Methodists
towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> social reform. At the same time, the work has been prepared
under the auspices of the Wesleyan Methodist Union for Social Service,
and this must be recognised, in full catalogues at any rate, by the
entry</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wesleyan Methodist Union for Social Service.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The citizen of to-morrow; ed. by S. E. Keeble.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[1906]</span><br />
</p>

<p>A book of this varied nature is a little puzzling in regard to its
right place in the classified catalogue, as some parts of it bear
on topics in the class Sociology, though in the aggregate it may be
regarded as belonging to Social Ethics, and so is marked 177.</p>

<p>In the books hitherto taken as examples, no entries have been given
under the first words of the titles, as it is not considered that
they are required. There is the remote possibility in this instance
of the book being remembered by its title, but that does not justify
the entry, as any person interested would remember one of the three
entries already given. When it is thought essential or desirable
to give a title-entry, it will be shown as we proceed. The older
catalogues of popular libraries were largely based upon the principle
of a title-entry for every item; the first or some other striking word
of the title-page being taken; it being considered rank heresy to go
behind the words of the title, as already mentioned. The result was
often confusing, if not actually misleading. A case in point is that of
the first book we took in illustration (page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>). Under the old system
this would have appeared as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portugal, In. By A. F. G. Bell.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>while Lady Jackson's "Fair Lusitania," though identical in subject,
would be in another part of the catalogue, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lusitania, Fair. By Lady Jackson.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It may be noted in passing that every book taken so far in illustration
is virtually without a punctuation mark of any kind on the title-page.
If the title-pages had been punctuated by the printer, it is probable
that no two of them would have been alike in principle, therefore the
cataloguer must provide the punctuation as he proceeds, certainly it
cannot be left to the printer. The entry above under "Keeble" lends
itself to an explanation of the punctuation used in it. The parentheses
enclosing the (<em>Ed.</em>) serve to isolate it from the initials of the
author's name, and so prevent misunderstanding in that respect.
Occasionally the form used is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Keeble</span> (Samuel E.) <em>ed.</em></span><br />
</p>

<p>A colon is used between the title of the book ("The citizen of
to-morrow") and its explanatory sub-title ("a handbook on social
questions") which makes the distinction clear. If the second title were
an alternative one preceded by "or," the first title is followed by a
semi-colon and the second preceded by a comma, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The citizen of to-morrow; or, a handbook on social</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">questions.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The printing of the name of the Union of Social Service in italics
enclosed in parentheses emphasises in some measure the fact that it is
published for that body, and indicates the point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> taken. In the
entry under "Wesleyan Methodist Union" the semi-colon before the "ed.
by S. E. Keeble" is a good form, separating the name from the title of
the book without cutting it off altogether as a full stop would do.
On the other hand, if he were the sole author of the book, the "ed.,"
being omitted, the "by" would be preceded by a comma, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wesleyan Methodist Union for Social Service.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The citizen of to-morrow, by S. E. Keeble.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The next is apparently of the same kind as the two preceding books, yet
it calls for quite different treatment. The title-page reads</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Essays and studies by members of the English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Association. Collected by A. C. Bradley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here the English Association in its corporate capacity is regarded as
the author of its own publications, the editor or collector occupying
a subsidiary place, more particularly in this case, as each of the
three volumes of these <em>Essays and studies</em> so far published has a
different editor. Accordingly our entry becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">English Association, The. Essays and studies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">collected by A. C. Bradley. <em>Oxf.</em>, 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>with a reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bradley</span>, A. C. (<em>Ed.</em>) <em>See</em> English Association.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The volume contains seven essays, each by a different author upon a
separate subject, and, unlike the other two books, without a general
idea running through the whole. For full, and, indeed, for average
catalogues, each of these essays must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> reckoned with, both for
authors and subjects. Where space is not of much consequence, and it
is desired to catalogue the book fully, then the contents are set out
under the principal entry, and each of the essays dealt with as if it
were a distinct work. This is for the dictionary catalogue. To carry it
out adequately fifteen entries are necessary, and are here fully worked
out.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>This is the principal entry for the dictionary catalogue, and the only
one for the classified catalogue, where it is marked 820.6 (English
Literature. Societies.) The extent to which the contents of such a book
would be noticed in the indexes to a classified catalogue is a matter
of discretion, and presumably they would be ignored. Not so, however,
in the good dictionary catalogue; as it is a matter of every-day
experience with librarians to find that essays of the kind often give
the gist of a subject in such a way as to be sufficient for the needs
of most of those interested in it, and, moreover, such an article or
essay may prove to be the only contribution to the subject appearing
in the catalogue, or the only one the library contains. The further
entries then for the dictionary catalogue are these:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bradley</span>, Henry. English place-names. (English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Assoc, essays.) 1910</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Place-Names</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bradley, H. English place-names. (English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Assoc, essays.) 1910</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Names, Place. <em>See</em> Place-names.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is essential that the "(English Assoc, essays)" be in every entry as
a guide to the book containing the essay. More correctly it should be
given with more detail, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bridges</span>, Robert. On the present state of English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">pronunciation. (English Assoc. Essays and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">studies.) 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>but the shorter form serves its purpose.</p>

<p>For the subject-entry of this last item we can choose between
"Pronunciation, English," "English Pronunciation," and "Phonetics." An
examination of the essay proves that for several reasons the first is
the best to select, and it becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Pronunciation, English</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bridges, R. The present state of English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">pronunciation. (English Assoc, essays.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>The matter can be easily put right, as before, by the serviceable
references</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">English pronunciation. <em>See</em> Pronunciation, English.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Phonetics. <em>See also</em> Pronunciation.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The apparent frequency of such references seems to suggest that the
catalogue would be chiefly composed of references, but as a matter of
actual practice this is not so, as often a single reference serves for
many books.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ker</span>, W. P. Browning. (English Assoc, essays.)</span><br />

</p>

<p>This heading is likely to be so large in quantity of material that it
will need some sub-division of the works <em>on</em> Shakespeare (which will
follow those <em>by</em> him.)</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Sichel</span>, Edith. Some suggestions about bad</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">poetry. (English Assoc. essays.) 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>A heading of this kind, of course, only includes books <em>upon</em> poetry as
a subject, and not works because they are written in <em>poetical form</em>.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Vaughan</span>, C. E. Carlyle and his German masters.</span><br />

</p>

<p>The suggestion made in the Shakespeare entry above also applies to this
Carlyle entry. There is no occasion to repeat the heading of Carlyle
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> subject when printing, as this style of type seems to imply, though
it is sometimes done, and there is nothing against it. Books <em>by</em> and
<em>on</em> an author can be distinguished by the use of the dash and indent,
as below, or by printing the books <em>on</em> in smaller type.</p>

</p>

<p>If the exigencies of space necessitate making choice between setting
out the contents of a volume of this miscellaneous character, as in the
principal entry above, or index-entries for author and subject in this
way, there can be no question that indexing is the better, because each
of the articles is a contribution to the subject, and if not so indexed
is lost. This loss must perforce be risked when the collections are so
voluminous that they require an enormous number of entries to complete.
Unless space and expense are of no consequence, there is no alternative
but to dispense with the index entries. Sainte Beuve's <cite>Causeries du
lundi</cite> is a case in point, and the opposite course of setting out the
contents of these volumes under the principal entry must suffice for
most catalogues.</p>

<p>Whatever doubt may arise as to the policy of indexing such a work,
none whatever exists as to the necessity for dealing separately with
the contents of a volume which consists in reality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> several works
brought together by an editor or publisher. A good example of this is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ideal commonwealths: Plutarch's Lycurgus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">More's Utopia, Bacon's New Atlantis, Campanella's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">City of the Sun, and a fragment of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hall's Mundus alter et idem; with an introduction</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Henry Morley. 10th edition.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">London: Routledge.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Each of the individual works must be catalogued separately and
completely precisely as if each were a separate publication. The
main-entry may appear under the name of Morley as editor (though his
share in the production seems to consist merely of a preface of four
pages) in this form</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Morley</span>, Henry (<em>Ed.</em>) Ideal commonwealths. n.d.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Plutarch's Lycurgus. More's Utopia. Bacon's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">New Atlantis. Campanella's City of the Sun. Hall's</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mundus alter et idem (fragment).</span><br />
</p>

<p>The subordinate or added entries in this case being given under each
author.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Plutarch.</span> Life of Lycurgus. (Morley. Ideal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">More</span>, Sir Thomas. Utopia. (Morley. Ideal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, Francis, <em>Lord</em>. New Atlantis. (Morley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ideal commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Campanella</span>, Tommaso. The City of the Sun.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(Morley. Ideal commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Hall</span>, Joseph. Mundus alter et idem; transl. by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wm. King. (Morley. Ideal commonwealths.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the Campanella item above the Christian name is kept in the
vernacular, as it is a customary rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> to so enter all names instead of
anglicizing them, even when the books are translations.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing entries, all the works contained in the
book, the Plutarch excepted, will need title-entries in the dictionary
catalogue.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Utopia. More, Sir T. (Morley. Ideal commonwealths.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The "(Morley. Ideal commonwealths)" must be inserted in every entry as
a guide to the book containing the works. The form more correctly is
"(Morley, H. (<em>Ed.</em>) Ideal commonwealths.)", though the shorter form is
sufficiently distinctive. Even this could be left out if it happened
that the entry covered the only edition of any of the books contained
in a library, when the usual shelf-mark attached to the entry might be
regarded as a sufficient guide, and the entry reduced to the simplest
form of</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Utopia. More, Sir T. n.d. 320.1</span><br />
</p>

<p>though this is not recommended.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a library had a collection of editions of the
<cite>Utopia</cite>, it would be a good and reasonable economy to cover the whole
by a reference to the author's name, where they would be found set out
in detail, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Utopia. More, Sir T. <em>See under</em> More, Sir</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thomas.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The remaining entries, continued on the same lines, are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">New Atlantis. Bacon, Lord. (Morley. Ideal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">City of the Sun, The. Campanella, T. (Morley.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ideal commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mundus alter et idem. Hall, J. (Morley. Ideal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">commonwealths.) n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>For the classified catalogue the full entry, as shown under Morley
above, is numbered 320.1 (Political Science. Theory of the State), and
each author must appear in the index.</p>

<p>The foregoing rules and suggestions are also applicable to works of a
varied character when the work of a <em>single author</em>&mdash;volumes of essays
usually meriting and receiving separate entries under the subjects.
Fletcher's <cite>A. L. A. Index to General Literature, Boston</cite>, 1905,
is a useful work of reference in this connection, though it does not
compensate for the want of the indexing referred to in this chapter.</p>

<p>A volume may consist of a number of essays or articles by an individual
author upon topics so closely related that they are a contribution to a
single subject. Such, for example, is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

    <td class="tdp1">937</td>

<p>This is lettered on the publisher's cover "Essays on Roman History."
The contents of the volume, which should be set out under the above
entry, are</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Although so miscellaneous in character, this book requires but one
subject-entry, as it would be a work of supererogation to index each
essay separately.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

Illustrated Books. Music.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Authors and Illustrators. Translations of Foreign Titles
of Books of Illustrations and of Music. The
Cataloguing of Music. Librettists. "Indexing"
Miscellaneous Music. Dates of Publication.</p></div>


<p>In these days of cheap processes of reproduction of illustrations,
particularly in colour, the cataloguer is called upon to decide whether
the author (that is, the writer of the text) or the illustrator is the
more important person in connection with a book.</p>

<p>The real occasion of a book's existence may be that an artist has
produced a series of pictures considered to be worth reproduction, and
the author has been engaged to write appropriate text for them. To put
it another way, the former custom was for the artist to illustrate
an author's text, whereas nowadays an author may write text for
illustrations. This does not by any means imply that the text in itself
is not valuable apart from the illustrations, and therefore most of
such books need double entry, or at least references, as in the case of
joint-authors. The following three books are of this class:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hampshire, painted by Wilfrid Ball, <span class="smcap">R.E.</span>, described</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Rev. Telford Varley, <span class="smcap">M.A., B.SC.</span> 1909</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Kent, by W. Teignmouth Shore, painted by W.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Biscombe Gardner. 1907</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Channel Islands, painted by Henry B. Wimbush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">described by Edith F. Carey. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>In each of these examples the first-named, whether artist or author,
should be taken for the main-entry, but the mode of entry does not
follow that for joint-authors; the share of each in the book must be
shown, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ball</span>, Wilfrid (<em>Illus.</em>) Hampshire; described by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Telford Varley. pp. xii., 316, 75 col. illus.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">map. 1909</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Varley</span>, Telford. Hampshire described; [illus.]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by W. Ball. 1909</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ball, W., &amp;c. Hampshire painted and described.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1909</span><br />
</p>

<p>For short-entry catalogues, or as an economy, the "added entry" for the
second of the persons named may be reduced to the reference, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Varley</span>, Telford. <em>See</em> Ball, Wilfrid.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Where the artist's name appears in the secondary place, as in the
second book, a reference like this meets all reasonable requirements,
though the same cannot be said when the writer of the text occupies
that place, as in the first instance, and an entry is preferable to the
reference if the trifling additional space can be afforded. In reality
it does not resolve itself into a question of sparing space for the
entry of a particular book, but of finding room for many similar cases.</p>

<p>The second book is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Shore</span>, W. Teignmouth. Kent; [illus.] by W.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Biscombe Gardner. pp. x., 240, 73 col.</span><br />

<p>The abbreviation "illus." is used equally to mean illustrator,
illustrated, and, in the collation, illustrations, without any
likelihood of confusion of idea by a person of ordinary intelligence,
the position and context denoting the meaning. Sometimes this
abbreviation is curtailed to "il.", or "ill.", with a loss of
clearness, and as no real saving of space results, it cannot be
recommended.</p>

<p>The third book is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wimbush</span>, Henry B. (<em>Illus.</em>) The Channel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Islands; described by Edith F. Carey. pp.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">xiv., 294, 76 col. illus., map. 1904</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Carey</span>, Edith F. The Channel Islands; [illus.]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by H. B. Wimbush. 1904</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Channel Islands, The</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wimbush, H. B., &amp;c. The Channel Islands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">painted and described. 1904</span><br />
</p>

<p>As a rule there is no occasion for the cataloguer to notice the
illustrator, except for books of this special character. Where the
artist is famous and his illustrations lend value to a book, or where
books are likely to be required because illustrated by a notable
artist, it is well to mark the fact either by entry or reference. Such
illustrators as Bewick, Beardsley, Blake, Brangwyn, Crane, Cruikshank,
Dulac, "Phiz," Rackham, Rowlandson, Hugh Thomson, Turner, to name a
dozen among the best known, should be noticed, either by entry under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
their names, or after the manner shown in the following entries.
Suppose the first book received is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tales from Shakespeare, by Charles and Mary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lamb, illustrated by Arthur Rackham. 1909</span><br />
</p>

<p>we proceed to write our main-entry, taking care to note that the book
is illustrated by this particular artist,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, Charles and Mary. Tales from Shakespeare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">illus. by Arthur Rackham. 1909.</span><br />
</p>

<p>We then give the reference from the artist</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rackham</span>, Arthur (<em>Illus.</em>) <em>See</em> Lamb, Charles and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mary.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Later we get a book, the title-page of which reads</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Rhinegold and the Valkyrie, by Richard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wagner, with illustrations by Arthur Rackham,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">translated by Margaret Armour. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>and on the half-title we find</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Ring of the Niblung a trilogy with a prelude</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Richard Wagner translated into English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Margaret Armour. I.</span><br />
</p>

<p>so we combine and adapt the two titles, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wagner</span>, Richard. The Ring of the Niblung;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">transl. by Margt. Armour; illus. by Arthur</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Rackham. I. 1910</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">I, The Rhinegold. The Valkyrie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and give the usual references</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Armour</span>, Margaret (<em>Transl.</em>) <em>See</em> Wagner,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Richard.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rackham</span>, Arthur (<em>Illus.</em>) <em>See</em> Wagner, Richard.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Transl." is a perfectly clear abbreviation for either translated or
translator&mdash;the shorter form, "tr.", may mean anything, and is to be
avoided.</p>

<p>Later still we get another book, the principal entry for which is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Barrie</span>, Jas. M. Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">illus. by Arthur Rackham. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>when we make another reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rackham</span>, Arthur (<em>Illus.</em>) <em>See</em> Barrie, Jas. M.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Last of all we receive the second part of "The Ring of the Niblung,"
which we embody in the former entry, converting it into</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wagner</span>, Richard. The Ring of the Niblung;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">transl. by Margt. Armour; illus. by Arthur</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Rackham. 2 v. 1910-11</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">v. 1. The Rhinegold. The Valkyrie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">v. 2. Siegfried. The twilight of the gods.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If we have forgotten that the former reference was made, which is
unlikely, we make another, as before</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rackham</span>, Arthur (<em>Illus.</em>) <em>See</em> Wagner, Richard.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the time comes for printing the catalogue, if it has not already
been done, these references are all amalgamated into:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rackham</span>, Arthur (<em>Illus.</em>) <em>See</em> Barrie, Jas. M.;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lamb, Chas. and Mary; Wagner, Richard.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A certain amount of knowledge and discretion is required in cataloguing
the illustrators of books; cheap modern reprints of standard books with
illustrations by Cruikshank or "Phiz" hardly call for notice by the
cataloguer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Although it is the duty of the cataloguer to adhere to the language
of the title-page in transcribing a title, it is conceivable that the
usefulness of books in foreign languages, when they consist altogether
or mainly of illustrations, may be extended in popular libraries, if a
free explanatory translation of the title or a note is attached to the
entry, after the manner shown in the following three entries:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">S&eacute;guy</span>, E. Les fleurs et leurs applications d&eacute;coratives</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">[Flowers and their application in ornament].</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">pl. 30. f<sup>o</sup> <em>Paris</em>, [1903]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">R&eacute;mon</span>, Georges. Soixante planches de peintre</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">d&eacute;corative. f<sup>o</sup> <em>Dourdan</em>, n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Sixty plates in colour for house decoration.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, Jos., und Ed. <span class="smcap">Mader</span>. Neue Dekorations-Malereien</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">im modernen Stil. pl. 60.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">f<sup>o</sup> <em>Wien</em>, [1904]</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Original ornamental designs in colour.</span><br />
</p>

<p>So far as the orthodox rules for cataloguing are concerned, it is
something of a heresy to suggest that, as these books contain no text,
the original titles might be ignored, and a translation alone be given
if space is a consideration, but if so catalogued, they would make a
larger appeal in many libraries, and, after all, books are catalogued
for the purpose of ensuring that they shall be used. The entries might
be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">S&eacute;guy</span>, E. Flowers and their application in ornament,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">pi. 30. f<sup>o</sup> [1903]</span><br />
</p>

<p>It must be understood that this translation is not a recommendation,
but is only by way of suggestion, as there are not many books similar
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> character. If the suggestion is adopted, it must be carried out
uniformly through all entries.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">R&eacute;mon</span>, Georges. Sixty plates of decorative</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">painting [house]. f<sup>o</sup> n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, J., and E. <span class="smcap">Mader</span>. New painted decorations</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">in the modern style, pl. 60. f<sup>o</sup> [1904]</span><br />
</p>

<p>The subject entries and references required for these books are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Ornament</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">S&eacute;guy, E. Les fleurs et leurs applications</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">d&eacute;coratives. 1903</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Decoration. <em>See</em> Ornament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Design, Ornamental. <em>See</em> Ornament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Flowers in ornament. <em>See</em> Ornament.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The first two references are for synonymous terms for the subject. The
last is required for two reasons. Firstly, there are sure to be other
books in the catalogue in which floral design will form the principal
feature without any reference to flowers on the title-page; secondly, a
book of the kind is better placed under the subject-word "Ornament" or
whatever term is taken for the decorative arts, rather than "Flowers",
to prevent it being mistaken for a work on botany or gardening.</p>

<p>The next book is on ornament as applied to house decoration only,
and the designs are not meant for other purposes, certainly not for
ornament generally, therefore the entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>House Decoration</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">R&eacute;mon, G. Soixante planches de peintre</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">d&eacute;corative. n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>and the supplementary references are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Decoration, House. <em>See</em> House Decoration.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ornament. <em>See also</em> House Decoration.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If the title of this book were printed "60 planches de peintre
d&eacute;corative", and the title had to be transcribed in full, the language
of the original must be followed, and not a hybrid title given, as
"Sixty planches de peintre d&eacute;corative".</p>

<p>The third book, being upon ornament in general, receives an entry
accordingly</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Ornament</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lehner, J., &amp;c. Neue Dekorations-Malereien</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">im modernen Stil. [1904]</span><br />
</p>

<p>No further references are needed beyond those already given to the
first of these three books. It would be literally correct but none the
less pedantic to convert the "&amp;c." of the above entry to "u.s.w." (und
so weiter), as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lehner, J., u.s.w.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and such a procedure is not recommended.</p>

<p>The entries of the first and third of these books would be marked for
the classified catalogue 745 (Art. Ornamental Design), and the second
729.4 (Art. Architectural Design and Decoration. Painted Decoration),
the index-entries being</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">S&eacute;guy, E. Les fleurs d&eacute;coratives, 745</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ornament, 745</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Floral Ornament, 745</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Decoration, Ornamental, 745</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">R&eacute;mon, G. Peintre d&eacute;corative, 729.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">House Decoration, 729.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Decoration, House, 729.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lehner u. Mader. Dekorations-Malereien, 745</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing suggestion for the translation of title-pages, where the
text of the book is nonexistent or immaterial, is also applicable in
the case of music, more especially instrumental music, as many persons
understand music without understanding continental languages, and
therefore to give a translation of the title-pages of musical works
(not works <em>upon</em> music, which is a different matter) in a catalogue
may serve a most useful purpose. Take these as examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, Ludwig van.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">S&auml;mmtliche Sinfonien f&uuml;r das Pianoforte zu</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">zwei und vier H&auml;nden; arrangirt von F. W.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Markull. No. 8-9, vierhandig. 4<sup>o</sup> <em>Wolfenb&uuml;ttel</em>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Jadassohn</span>, S.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sechs Clavierst&uuml;cke. 4<sup>o</sup> <em>Leipzig</em>, n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Leclair</span>, Jean M.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Le tombeau: sonate &agrave; violon avec la basse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">continue; arrang&eacute;e pour le violon avec accompagnement</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">de piano par Gustav Jensen. 4<sup>o</sup></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>There is no great reason why these and similar works should not be
usefully adapted for the catalogues of popular libraries at any rate, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>, Ludwig van.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Collected pianoforte symphonies; arranged by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">F. W. Markull. Nos. 8-9, Piano duet. 4<sup>o</sup></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>Wolfenb&uuml;ttel</em>, n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Jadassohn</span>, S.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Six pianoforte pieces. 4<sup>o</sup> <em>Leipzig</em>, n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Leclair</span>, Jean M.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Le tombeau: sonata, with continued thorough-bass;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">arranged for the violin, with piano</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">accompaniment by Gustav Jensen. 4<sup>o</sup> n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>As "Le tombeau" is the distinctive title of this particular piece, it
is as well to give it in the original form, or, if in translation, as
"Le tombeau (The tomb)." It should be unnecessary to add that, where
space is of no consideration, the above titles can be given in the
original with the translation following enclosed within brackets; to do
this would conform with literal accuracy.</p>

<p>As music is introduced here in connection with translated titles, we
may also at this place consider the whole question of cataloguing
it. Usually the catalogue of music is printed apart from the general
catalogue of a library, in the form of a class-list, the entries being
sub-divided into sections and divisions, according to the amount of
material.</p>

<p>Whether in a separate publication or in the general catalogue, the
composer occupies the place held by the authors of other works, and his
surname is taken for the main-entry, as shown in the following examples
of operas. The title-pages read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Maritana. Opera in three acts, the music composed by W. Vincent
Wallace. The words by Edward Fitzball. Edited by Myles B.
Foster. Boosey &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The Bohemians (founded upon "La vie de Boh&egrave;me" by Henry
Murger.) An opera in four acts by Giuseppe Giacosa and
Luigi Illica. Music by Giacomo Puccini. English version
of Acts I. and II. by William Grist, Acts III. and IV. by
Percy Pinkerton. Arranged by Carlo Carignani. G. Ricordi &amp;
Co. Copyright 1897. (Printed in Italy.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>and these we proceed to condense and adapt after this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, W. Vincent. Maritana: opera; words</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Edward Fitzball; ed. by Myles B. Foster.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">(<em>Royal ed.</em>) pp. ii., 284. n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Puccini</span>, Giacomo. The Bohemians: an opera by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica; English</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">version by Wm. Grist and Percy Pinkerton;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">arranged by Carlo Carignani. pp. viii., 204.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">4<sup>o</sup> 1897</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the first entry the added words denoting the edition are taken from
the printed cover of the book.</p>

<p>The above represent the full form for the dictionary catalogue. Any
additional entries would be in the way of references from the names of
the writers of the libretti, the translators, editors, or arrangers, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Fitzball</span>, Edward. <em>See</em> Wallace, W. Vincent.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Foster</span>, Myles B. <em>See</em> Wallace, W. Vincent.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It may be considered that the writer of the libretto is of equal
importance with the composer in such work, both often being named
together in connection therewith, as "the Gilbert-Sullivan operas."
It must be remembered, however, that in musical works like these the
libretto as given seldom represents the complete work of the author,
the spoken words being omitted; therefore, not only is his place
secondary, but his share in the work is incomplete. For this reason
even the reference can be dispensed with, except in full catalogues,
where every name is taken into account. In the contrary case, where
the words of an opera are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> published without the music, the reverse
method would be followed, and the name of the composer ignored for
cataloguing, because his work is not included.</p>

<p>Besides references as above, there is the possible usefulness of
title-entries (in the dictionary catalogue only), as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Maritana: opera. Wallace, W. V. n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bohemians, The: opera. Puccini, G. 1897</span><br />
</p>

<p>If the collection of music in a library is not sufficient to warrant
the publication of a separate catalogue, it is desirable to embody
in the dictionary catalogue a class-list of music under the heading
"Music", treated as subject, although this is not strictly in
accordance with the principles governing the compilation of such a
catalogue. The entries under the heading would be sub-divided as
required, in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Music.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><em>Operas</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">(<em>Vocal scores, with pianof. accom.</em>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Puccini, G. The Bohemians. 1897</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wallace, W. V. Maritana. n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Music and musical works fall logically into place as part of a
classified catalogue, and are as readily dealt with there as in a
separately published Catalogue of music. The two principal entries of
the above operas are marked 782.1 (Music&mdash;Dramatic Music&mdash;Opera.)</p>

<p>When a library contains an extensive or comparatively large selection
of music, there are sure to be included volumes of "albums," "gems,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"selections," and other miscellaneous collections, which in the
ordinary way are catalogued after this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Music.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;"><em>Pianof. solos.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Klassiker-Perlen: Gems from the classics.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">(<em>Conservatoire ed</em>.) Bk. 1. 4<sup>o</sup> n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Bk. 1. Prelude, C major, by Bach. Largo, by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Handel. Gavotte, by Gluck. Tr&auml;umerei, Warum?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">and Summerlied, by Schumann. Nocturne, by Field.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">The song of the lark, Chant sans paroles, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Bacarolle, by Tschaikowsky. Moment musical and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Menuett, by Schubert. Melody in F, by Rubinstein.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Unless the contents of such volumes are at least set out as above they
cannot be regarded as properly catalogued. If the library had any one
of these pieces as a separate publication, it would, no doubt, receive
individual treatment, and be dealt with in this way (to take the last
item in the above book):&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Music.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;"><em>Pianof. solos.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Rubinstein, Anton. Melody in F. (Op. 3,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">no. 1.) n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>For this reason, when the number of books is large, and the separate
catalogue, therefore, of considerable size, such miscellaneous
collections should be dealt with ("indexed") as if each item were a
separate work. If it is essential to index the contents of other books
of a miscellaneous character, it is doubly necessary for miscellaneous
music, more especially as it brings all the works of a composer
together according to the nature of the compositions. If this course is
pursued, then, as a counter-balancing economy, the contents need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
be set forth under the principal entry, the separate "indexing" being
sufficient, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Music.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><em>Pianof. solos.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bach, J. Sebastian. Prelude. (Gems from</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">the classics, Bk. 1.) n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This recommendation of separate entry is for a class-list of music
(that is, a separately-published catalogue of music), and only applies
to volumes containing works by several composers. Separate entries
are not required in the case of a collection of pieces by a single
composer. One entry only is needed, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Music.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><em>Pianof. solos.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Menynski, M. Esquisses russes pour piano.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">pp. 48. 4<sup>o</sup> n.d.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This contains six pieces, each with a distinctive title, and these
titles can be set out, if thought well, as contents <em>under the above
entry</em>. No further entries should be given, even in the dictionary
catalogue, as title-entries for the items in works of this kind are
superfluous.</p>

<p>There are, also, many collections of miscellaneous music much too
comprehensive to allow of the separate cataloguing of each item, and
these must, of necessity, be simply catalogued, even without the
contents being set out. Examples of collections of this type are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Experience proves that no useful purpose is served by giving the dates
of publication of modern music in an ordinary catalogue; in fact, it
can only be given in exceptional cases, the majority being "n.d.", as
the above examples testify. The works of the classic masters appear in
so many forms and editions that the dates, when ascertained, are of no
particular help.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

Publications of Governments, Societies, and Corporate Bodies.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Co-operative Indexes. Publications of Societies.
Publishing Societies. Government Publications.
Statutes. Colonial and Foreign Government
Publications. Local Government Publications.
Associations and Institutions. Congresses.</p></div>


<p>The extent to which the work of dissecting and "indexing" the contents
of books of a miscellaneous nature is to be carried out in a library
catalogue depends largely on the nature and purpose of the library,
though a limit must be set to it in any case. It would be unusual to
index the proceedings or transactions of a society, or the contents
of reviews, or other periodical publications, however valuable they
might be. For this most libraries must depend upon the co-operative
indexes, such as the <cite>Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific
Papers</cite>, the <cite>International Catalogue of Scientific Literature</cite>,
the <cite>International Institute of Technical Bibliography</cite>, Poole's
<cite>Index to Periodical Literature</cite>, the <cite>Engineering Index</cite>, the <cite>Index
to Arch&aelig;ological Papers</cite> (unfortunately of little value because it is
only an index of authors instead of subjects), and other works of the
kind. The Library Association publishes a <cite>Class-Catalogue of Current
Serial Digests and Indexes of the Literature of Pure and Applied
Science</cite>.</p>

<p>The form of entry for the publications of societies will vary according
to their nature. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> already stated, societies or other bodies in
their corporate capacity are regarded as the authors of their memoirs,
transactions, proceedings, journals, etc., and entry is made under
their names accordingly. The question arises, under what part of the
name? and it may be laid down in general terms that if a society be
national or general in its scope and character, and its headquarters
are in London, then the first word of the official name of the society,
other than an article, is the correct entry-word. The following are
illustrative examples of this:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Royal Society of London. Catalogue of scientific</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">papers, 1800-1900. Subject-index, v. 3,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Physics, pt. 1. <em>Camb.</em>, 1913</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Society of Antiquaries of London. Arch&aelig;ologia;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">or, miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">v. 1-59, with indexes. 4<sup>o</sup> 1770-1905</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chemical Society. Abstract of papers. 17 v.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1896-1912</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Linnean Society. Proceedings, 1838-55. 2 v.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1849-55</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">British Association for the Advancement of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Science. Reports. 20 v. 1891-1910</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Institution of Civil Engineers. Minutes of proceedings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">v. 56-142. 1879-1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the society be national for Scotland, Wales, or
Ireland, or provincial, colonial, or foreign, the entry-word depends
upon the nature of the society. The publications of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, for instance, might be better placed under "Edinburgh,
Royal Society" than under "Scotland. Royal Society of Edinburgh,"
notwithstanding that it is a national and not a local body. Against
this, the publications of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland are
better entered under "Scotland, Society of Antiquaries of," although
there is much to be said in favour of treating such important bodies
after the manner shown in the previous entries, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Royal Society of Edinburgh.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.</span><br />
</p>

<p>in which case these references are necessary:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scotland, Society of Antiquaries of. <em>See</em> Society</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of Antiquaries of Scotland.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Edinburgh, Royal Society of. <em>See</em> Royal Society</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of Edinburgh.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The British Museum practice is inconvenient and affords no help in
cataloguing the publications of societies, because all of them are
brought together, irrespective of character, country, or locality,
under the general heading of "Academies," and arranged according to
the names of the places of publication in one general alphabet (not in
national or geographical order), as Abbeville, Aberdeen, Abo, Acireale,
Adelaide, etc. If it is desired to find say the "Proceedings of the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers," it is necessary to turn first to
"Academies," and then to "Birmingham," provided one knows or remembers
that the Institution has its centre there. Publications like those of
the Early English Text Society or the Hakluyt Society must be sought
first under "Academies" and afterwards under "London." This method
of general, then local entry, is not a simple and ready one. Even
local entry is not always satisfactory, as often enough the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
publication or of the meetings of a society are merely incidental, and,
therefore, the proceedings of a county antiquarian society should be
entered under the name of the county or society, and not the place&mdash;the
Kent Arch&aelig;ological Society under Kent and not Maidstone, the Historic
Society of Lancashire and Cheshire under Lancashire ("Lancashire and
Cheshire, Historic Society of"), not under Liverpool, and the Chetham
Society under that distinctive name, not under Manchester. These
societies cause little or no trouble, as their names usually suggest
the best entry-word, even in the case of foreign societies.</p>

<p>It must clearly be understood that when a society is established for
the publication of separate works upon subjects coming within the scope
of the society's purpose, and not for the reading and discussion of
papers, its publications require full cataloguing, as if each work had
been issued independently, in addition to whatever entry is given under
the name of the society. A case in point would be this:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chetham Society. Remains, historical and literary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">connected with the palatine counties of Lancaster</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and Chester, v. 61, new ser. <em>M'chester</em>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1907</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">v. 6. Materials for the history of Lancaster, by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Wm. Oliver Roper. Pt. 1.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the main-entry in full catalogues. The essential sub-entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Roper</span>, Wm. O. Materials for the history of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lancaster. Pt. 1. (<em>Chetham Soc.</em>, v. 61, new</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">ser.) 1907</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Lancaster</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Roper, W. O. Materials for the history of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Lancaster. Pt. 1. (<em>Chetham Soc.</em>, v. 61,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">new ser.) 1907</span><br />
</p>

<p>Whatever economy may be exercised, neither of these two last entries
can be dispensed with, rather let the list of contents and the volumes
under the main-entry be omitted, especially if the list is a long one,
involving a hunt through many items to find a particular book. Under
ordinary circumstances a summary entry for a whole set can be made to
suffice in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chetham Society. Remains, historical and literary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">connected with the palatine counties of Lancaster</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and Chester. 116 v. <em>M'chester</em>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1844-93</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Includes indexes to v. 1-30 and v. 31-114.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Similar entries for the whole set would be made under "Lancashire" and
"Cheshire." By this arrangement a person requiring a particular work in
the series could find it by reference to the entry under the author's
name, or under the definite subject, if the book does not deal with
either of these counties in general, and one or the other is certain
to be remembered. It may be explained that the summary entry for the
whole series, when given under the names of the two counties, obviates
any necessity for separately entering any particular book under these
counties. For example, the late Chancellor Christie's volume (No. 7 of
the new series) on the old church and school libraries of Lancashire
requires no separate entry under "Lancashire," as it is covered by the
general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> entry under the name of this county&mdash;the separate entries are
given under "Christie" and "Libraries."</p>

<p>The book by Roper, taken in illustration above, which is given as "Pt.
1," does not require a second entry for Pt. 2 when it is received
later. All that is necessary is to adapt the entries in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chetham Society. Remains (<em>and the rest of the</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>entry as before</em>).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">v. 61-62. Materials for the history of Lancaster, by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Wm. Oliver Roper. 2 v.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Roper</span>, Wm. O. Materials for the history of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lancaster. (<em>Chetham Soc.</em>, v. 61-62, new</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">ser.) 2 v. 1907</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Lancaster</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Roper, W. O. Materials for the history of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Lancaster. (<em>Chetham Soc.</em>, v. 61-62,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">new ser.) 2 v. 1907</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are other societies which publish separate and independent books,
lending themselves to this separate treatment, when each work must be
dealt with individually. Among them may be named the Camden, Early
English Text, Folk-Lore, Hakluyt, Harleian, Malone, Navy Records, and
Surtees Societies.</p>

<p>These publications present the same problem for the classified
catalogue as they do for shelf-classification, viz., shall they be kept
together under the name of the Society, or be distributed throughout
the catalogue according to the nature of their contents? If the volumes
of the Camden Society or the Hakluyt Society are so scattered, they
appear in many parts of the catalogue, whereas they are not usefully
entered if grouped together. Some of the other societies do not raise
this difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and the correct solution appears to be, as in the
case of the dictionary catalogue, to give a general entry for the
whole set in its place, and a separate entry for each volume in its
own particular place. It is true there is usually a special place in
the Dewey Classification for such collections (the Hakluyt Society is
910.6), but whether the volumes are all kept together on the shelves
or not, they are virtually lost for usefulness unless, as already
suggested, the entries are distributed according to countries or other
subjects in the catalogue.</p>

<p>The publications of the state, of local government authorities, and
other official bodies are regarded in much the same light for the main
entry as societies. In a British catalogue the publications of the
home government or its departments cannot be usefully or conveniently
grouped together under a general heading of "England" or "Great
Britain," but are better placed under the names of the respective
departments. On the other hand, the publications of any other
government and its departments are brought together under the name
of the state, and those of the governing body of any specified area,
local, home, or colonial, under the name of that area. These points can
be made plainer by examples. To take the home government reports first:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="home government reports">
  <tr>
    <td>Local Government Board. Annual report, 1908-9. 2 v. 1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">352.042</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Board of Trade, Labour Department. Abstract of labour statistics of the United Kingdom, 1908-9. 1911</td>
    <td class="tdp1">331.8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Board of Education. Special reports on educational subjects, v. 21. 1907</td>
    <td class="tdp1">372.942</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">v. 21. School excursions and vacation schools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Imperial Education Conference, 1911. Report. 1911</td>
    <td class="tdp1">370.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Report, 1911. 1912</td>
    <td class="tdp1">352.2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>While these official titles of the respective departments are the
correct form of entry, there is no particular objection to reversing
the titles, when they admit of it, thus bringing them under the name of
the public service concerned, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Trade, Board of, Labour Department.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Education, Board of.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Education Conference, Imperial.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Police, Commissioner of, of the Metropolis.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Any necessary guiding references must be furnished if required, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Board of Trade. <em>See</em> Trade, Board of.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Board of Education. <em>See</em> Education, Board of.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Imperial Education Conference. <em>See</em> Education Conference.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If the entries are so reversed, this does not convert them into a
combined form of corporate-author and subject-entries; they will still
need entries under whatever subject to which they appertain, unless a
reference is substituted to meet the case under the subject. Should a
library contain, say, many of the volumes of the special reports of the
Board of Education, or a collection of the various reports on Labour
issued by the Board of Trade, the setting of them out in detail twice
over can be avoided by these two references</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Education.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Education, Board of.</span><br />
<br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The police report can be entered under "London," though by "Metropolis"
is meant a much larger district than that usually understood as
London, as it includes several outside county and other boroughs while
excluding the City itself. Nominally the report is that of the chief
officer, but there is no occasion to enter it under his name.</p>

<p>Upon the principle already outlined, editions of the statutes would, in
the ordinary course, be entered under "Parliament," but it is better
to take a separate heading, as "Acts of Parliament" or "Statutes,
British," referring from "Parliament." Illustrative examples are</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Acts of Parliament</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Statutes, The. A.D. 1235-1900. 2nd revised</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">ed. 20 v. 1888-1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">346.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Chitty's Statutes of practical utility. 6th</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">ed., by W. H. Aggs. v. 1-14. 1911-13</td>
    <td class="tdp1">346.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Statutes, British. <em>See</em> Acts of Parliament.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Parliament. <em>See also</em> Acts of Parliament.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Law. <em>See also</em> Acts of Parliament.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>References should be given from the names of any editors, compilers,
digesters, or annotators, as Chitty and Aggs. A volume of Acts relating
to a specified subject, say, Copyright, Theatres, or Workmen, is not
entered under the general heading, but under the name of the subject
and the compiler. Such works ordinarily contain the law as well as the
statutes, and therefore any references required from the general to
the particular would be given under "Law." Legislative publications of
other countries corresponding to our Acts of Parliament are entered
under the names of those countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The manner of stating the number of volumes in the second (Chitty)
of the above examples indicates that the work is still in course of
publication; if it were complete the number of volumes would be given
as in the first entry. This first entry also takes precedence of the
Chitty for order because it is the official "By authority" edition.</p>

<p>As said above, the publications of colonial and foreign governments are
first entered under the names of places, then by departments, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="the publications of colonial and foreign governments are

<p>An item like that of the U.S. Bureau of Education needs entries for
subject and for the author of the particular section. Presuming
that the whole series is covered under the heading "Education" by a
reference to "United States. Bureau of Education," the other entries are</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these entries raises a question in connection with double
place-names, i.e., should the entry be given as above or under "West"?
Following the recommendation of the Joint-Code rule (No. 130), three
standard gazetteers were consulted; two gave the name under "Virginia"
(as in our entry), and one under "West." Accumulation of headings in
one place is prevented when place-names qualified by the points of the
compass, or in some similar way, are entered under the name following
the prefix. All the same, each name must be considered independently.
To enter New York or New Zealand under "York" and "Zealand" is
incorrect, though the Isle of Man or the Isle of Wight are better under
"Man" and "Wight" respectively. If there is the least doubt give the
reference, which in this case is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">West Virginia. <em>See</em> Virginia, West.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Examples of local government publications would be</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="local government publications">
   <tr>
    <td>London County Council. Statistical abstract for</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">London, 1911-12. v. 14. 1912</td>

   <tr>

    <td class="tdr">f&nbsp;371.74</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The "f" attached to the classification numbers is meant to mark the
book as a folio, and, while indicating the size, serves also as a guide
to its probable position on the shelves, because folios are not usually
placed with octavos. If the book were a quarto, it would be marked "q",
as "q 371.74".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Another local government publication is</p>

<p>The libraries of various localities usually make a point of obtaining
all reports and documents bearing upon their particular areas,
and, therefore, need special methods both for classification and
cataloguing, according to the extent of their collections, so we may
consider how the above items may be treated in a typical London public
library. Presuming that all the publications of the London County
Council are received, they would be so numerous that it is not worth
while entering them again under "London" as subject. The entries under
"London County Council" and under "London" would not only be many in
number, but would come together in the catalogue. A better plan is
carefully to enter all under "London County Council", subdividing the
entries according to their nature. Though the Hammersmith report needs
a reference under "London", an entry thereunder could not be justified,
as in the case of the publications of the larger body. The references
would be in this manner</p>

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">London County Council.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is placed in order exactly as if it were an entry, whereas the
Hammersmith reference comes at the end of the entries in the usual way,
as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>See also the names of the Metropolitan boroughs</em>, as</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hammersmith, Shoreditch, Stepney.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the first form of what may be termed an "entry-reference" is
better exemplified by supposing it to be the most suitable style when
under a general heading like "Education", and the entry references are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Education</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Board of Education. Reports, &amp;c. <em>See</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Board of Education.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">London County Council. Education reports.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>See</em> London County Council.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">United States. Board of Education. Publications.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>See</em> United States.</span><br />
</p>

<p>These fall into place under the heading as "Board", "London", "United
States", and not as references at the end. This style is only
recommended where there are many entries under both the heading and the
name referred <em>to</em>, the ordinary method being</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Education</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Board of Education, London County</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Council, United States (Bureau of Education).</span><br />
</p>

<p>The foregoing principles for the entry of government documents also
apply to the publications of associations and institutions. The
officers making reports in an official capacity are usually disregarded
so far as their personal names are concerned, though at times a special
report or other publication may justify and require an entry under the
name of the writer, but this depends upon its nature. International
and local exhibitions are entered under the names of the places where
held, unless the organisations arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> such exhibitions are, more
or less, permanent bodies having exhibitions at intervals in different
places, when the entries are given, not under the names of places, but
under the official name of the organising body, as Royal Agricultural
Society, National Rose Society, International Horticultural Exhibition.</p>

<p>The same applies more particularly to congresses and conferences
of all kinds regularly held, the places of meeting being merely
incidental. The following is an example of such a congress, which is
held at intervals in different parts of the world, and with a certain
continuity:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="a congress, which is
held at intervals in different parts of the world, and with a certain
continuity">
   <tr>
    <td>National Council of Peace Societies. Official report</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>

    <td class="tdp2">July 27th to August 1st, 1908. 1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">172.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The National Council is, apparently, a central body representing
British peace societies, and is responsible for this report only. When
the congress is held in another country, presumably some body in that
country makes itself responsible for the publication of the report, in
which case it is probable the title would be in German or in French,
whichever country issues the report, and this must be remembered. The
title "Universal Congress of Peace", not being the name of a body,
but the purpose of the congress, is met by a subject-entry, the above
serving as a main-entry for this particular report.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="the purpose of the congress, is met by a subject-entry">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a subject-heading that permits of a concentration of books,
both for and against international peace, and may be made to include
those upon international arbitration, the Hague Conferences, reducing
of armaments, and other phases of the subject, even with the opposite
term of "war" in their titles, provided the books bear upon the
question in the ethical, social, or economic aspect, and are not purely
military in character. The references then would be of this nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">War <em>versus</em> Peace. <em>See</em> Peace Question.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Arbitration, International. <em>See</em> Peace Question.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Armaments, Reduction of. <em>See</em> Peace Question.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Militarism. <em>See</em> Peace Question.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The heading is better sub-divided, the books in favour of international
peace and arbitration leading, and those opposed to it following, under
some suitable sub-headings. Amalgamation of subjects under a single
heading is further referred to in Chapter XIV.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

Compound Names. Names with Prefixes. Greek and Roman Names.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Rendering of the Names of Foreign Authors. Compound
Names. Changed Names. Foreign Compound Names.
Names with Prefixes. Short Entries. Title-Entries.
Foreign Names with Prefixes. Greek and Latin
Authors.</p></div>


<p>We shall not have proceeded very far with the work of cataloguing
before problems in connection with the varying forms of personal names
will arise. Translations of works by foreign authors will, at times,
have varieties of renderings of their names, making it necessary to
hunt out and decide which is the vernacular form or transcription of
the name, and, therefore, the right one to adopt. An instance of a
troublesome name of the kind is that of the Russian novelist, rendered
upon title-pages as Turgenev, Turg&eacute;nieff, Tourgu&eacute;neff, Turgueniev, and
Tourg&eacute;nief.</p>

<p>Another source of worry is that of compound names, or their equivalent
hyphenated-surnames, that is to say, names compounded without the
authority of a deed-poll, or even without obligations as beneficiaries
under a will. It is a growing affectation, to which many persons
are partial, especially if their surnames happen to be among those
most common. A person is born, say, Smith, and having the maternal
surname as a second Christian name, he compounds with it, and Thomas
Jackson Smith in time becomes T. Jackson-Smith. Generally speaking,
the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> and most convenient plan is to enter all such names, if
English, under the last name. When authors have undoubtedly changed or
added to their names, and have written under both forms, this may be a
good reason for entering under the first part of a double name, though
the necessity for it can be obviated by the ever-useful reference.</p>

<p>Whatever method of entry may be adopted, the latest form of the name
must be given, particularly in the case of those who have written under
both forms. The Dean of Gloucester, for example, who has written some
historical works under his name of H. D. M. Spence, has now published a
guide to Gloucester Cathedral, under the name of H. D. M. Spence-Jones.
If the entries are retained under the first form of name, the "Jones"
must be added to all entries&mdash;subject as well as author; if the new
name is taken, it should be dealt with after the manner shown in the
next paragraph.</p>

<p>To enter under the last name will not be strictly in accordance with
the orthodox rules, but it will prove by far the most convenient method
for all concerned. Accordingly the undermentioned books are so entered,
and not under the double names of Eardley Wilmot, Betham Edwards, and
Collison Morley, although these writers may at times be spoken of by
their double names.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wilmot</span>, Sir S. Eardley. Forest life and sport in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">India, pp. viii., 324, illus. 1910</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, Matilda Betham. Unfrequented France</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by river, and mead, and town. pp. x., 204,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">illus. 1910</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Morley</span>, L. Collison-. Modern Italian literature.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">pp. viii., 356. 1911</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The hyphen may be put in, as shown in the last entry, but this is not
essential, at any rate in short-entry catalogues. Full catalogues give
the references</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Eardley-Wilmot</span>, Sir S. <em>See</em> Wilmot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Betham-Edwards</span>, Matilda. <em>See</em> Edwards.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Collison-Morley, L.</span> <em>See</em> Morley.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The cataloguer sometimes comes across a name which he may remember
as a decidedly changed name from his point of view, when there is no
alternative but to adopt the newer form. A writer, for example, who at
one time was known as F. H. Perry Coste, has now become Perrycoste,
and, unless the cataloguer's memory serves him well, this author's
books will be entered under Coste and Perrycoste.</p>

<p>The subject-entries of the foregoing books are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>India</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><em>Travel and Description.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wilmot, Sir S. E. Forest life and sport in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">India. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>As this book is for the most part concerned with state forestry in
India, it is likely to be serviceable in connection with forestry as a
subject, though not specifically upon it, the meaning of the rules may
be liberally interpreted to include the entry</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Forestry</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wilmot, Sir S. E. Forest life, &amp;c., in India.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1910.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of publication the author was a C.I.E., but later, becoming
a K.C.I.E., the "Sir" is added to his name.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>France</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><em>Travel and Description.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Edwards, M. B. Unfrequented France. 1910</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Italian Literature</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Morley, C. L. Modern Italian literature.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1911</span><br />
</p>

<p>The last book, not being upon literature in the universal sense or
in the abstract, is entered under its definite subject of Italian
literature as shown. Here the serviceable covering reference again
removes all possible doubt.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Literature.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also the names of national literatures as</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">English, Italian, Spanish.</span><br />
</p>

<p>To enter compound names under the last name, as recommended, does not
by any means imply that the first part of the hyphenated name should
be reduced to initials in the <em>principal entry</em> of even a short-form
catalogue, and, therefore, the briefest style for these names is
Wilmot, Sir S. Eardley; Edwards, M. Betham; Morley, L. Collison.</p>

<p>If the codes of rules which stipulate for entry under the first part of
a compound name are followed, the names are given after this fashion,
to take one of the above books in illustration,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Betham-Edwards</span>, Matilda. Unfrequented France</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by river, and mead, and town. pp. x., 204,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">illus. 1910</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>France</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Betham-Edwards, M. Unfrequented France.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1910</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The reverse form of reference then becomes necessary, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, Matilda Betham. <em>See</em> Betham-Edwards.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Dewey numbers for the classified catalogue of these three books are
respectively 915.4 (Geography and Travels&mdash;India), 914.4 (Geography and
Travels&mdash;France), and 850.9 (Literature&mdash;Italian Literature&mdash;History).
The index entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wilmot, Sir S. E. Forest life in India, 915.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">India (Travels) 915-4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Edwards, M. B. Unfrequented France, 914.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">France (Travels) 914.4</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Italian Literature (History), 850.9</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Morley, L. C. Mod. Italian literature, 850.9</span><br />
</p>

<p>Compound names are a greater source of worry where foreign authors are
concerned, and, irrespective of the rules, it is an excellent plan
to use a <em>native</em> biographical dictionary to ensure correctness of
entry. A rule of a general character may be laid down to the effect
that foreign names are subject to the opposite method of treatment to
that for English names, and the first part of the name is taken. It is
said, though the statement is not vouched for, that in France, and, no
doubt, elsewhere, such names are obtained in an odd way. A person say
of the name of Saluste lives in a small town and on the left bank of
the river running through it. In order that he may not be confused with
another person of the same name living in another part, he is spoken of
as Saluste of the Left Bank, and in course of time this distinguishing
name is absorbed by his family, its patronymic eventually becoming
Saluste de la Rive Gauche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>However this may be, the following represent the correct forms for such
names:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Barbey d'Aurevilly</span>, Jules. Ce qui ne meurt pas.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">2 v. <em>Paris</em>, n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Leroy-Beaulieu</span>, Pierre. La r&eacute;novation de l'Asie:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sib&eacute;rie, Chine, Japon. pp. xx., 482. <em>Paris</em>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1900</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Cantacuz&egrave;ne-Altieri</span>, Princesse Olga. Responsable.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">2me &eacute;d. pp. 349. <em>Paris</em>, 1897</span><br />
</p>

<p>Foreign names of this kind rarely require references from the latter or
other part of the name, but they may be given in very doubtful cases.</p>

<p>The first and third of these books being works of fiction, require no
subject-entries. Works of this class receive instead an entry under
the first word of the title, other than an article (a "title-entry"),
because people often remember and ask for such works by their titles
without knowing the author's names. These will be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ce qui ne meurt pas. Barbey d'Aurevilly, J.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">2 v. n.d.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Responsable. Cantacuz&egrave;ne-Altieri, Princesse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1897</span><br />
</p>

<p>While it is altogether against the principle of the dictionary
catalogue to gather novels together under a heading "Fiction" or
"Novels" in any part of it, yet there can be no objection to furnishing
a guide to the authors of fiction in a particular foreign language
contained in the catalogue after this style</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">French Fiction. <em>See the names of the following</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>authors</em>: Barbey d'Aurevilly, Cantacuz&egrave;ne-Altieri.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The second of the above books needs not only a subject-entry under
Asia, but also one under the names of the three countries dealt with in
it, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Asia, Eastern</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Leroy-Beaulieu, P. La r&eacute;novation de l'Asie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1900</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Siberia</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Leroy-Beaulieu, P. La r&eacute;novation de l'Asie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>with similar entries under "China" and "Japan," and references, binding
the whole together, in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">East, The Far. <em>See</em> Asia, Eastern.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Asia, Eastern.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> China. Japan. Siberia.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the translation of works by
a foreign author in no way alters the form of name. Because M.
Leroy-Beaulieu's name is attached to a book in English, it does not
bring him under the rules for English compound names, any more than it
makes an Englishman of him. This last book in translation, therefore,
appears as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Leroy-Beaulieu</span>, Pierre. The awakening of the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">East: Siberia, Japan, China; transl. by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Richard Davey, with a preface by [Sir] Henry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Norman. pp. xxviii., 299. 1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>The fullest form of catalogue will have references under the translator
and the writer of the preface, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Davey</span>, Richard (<em>Transl.</em>) <em>See</em> Leroy-Beaulieu,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Pierre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Norman</span>, Sir Henry. <em>See also</em> Leroy-Beaulieu,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Pierre.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The average catalogue will not only dispense with these references,
but may make them impossible by omitting to mention the names in the
main-entry.</p>

<p>It may be said in passing that it is customary to give works in the
original precedence over translations in the order of arrangement and
altogether irrespective of the alphabetical order of the titles. The
subject-entries for this work, being the same as before, need not be
repeated except to give both books under one of them to show this order</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Asia, Eastern</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Leroy-Beaulieu, P. La r&eacute;novation de l'Asie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1900</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash; The awakening of the East. 1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>The classified catalogue entry for the book will be marked 950
(History&mdash;Asia), although each of the countries named has a separate
number. The novels will fall into 843.89 (Literature&mdash;French
Fiction&mdash;Later 19th Century). Though this sub-division may be of
service on the shelves, it is more convenient in the catalogue to
arrange French fiction, or any other fiction, under a general number
(in this case 843), and place the entries in one alphabetical sequence
by authors' names without regard to their period. As a rule, however,
both on the shelves and in the catalogues fiction receives special
treatment.</p>

<p>Names with prefixes are also troublesome, and call for variation in
treatment according to nationality. In all British names the entry is
made under the prefix and not under the name following. Accordingly the
Fitzes, the Macs, the Aps, and the O's attached to names are regarded
as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> embodied in them, as FitzHerbert, McColl, Ap John, O'Brien,
and all with similar prefixes are brought together. This statement also
applies to those surnames preceded by "St." The following are examples
of all these:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Fitz-Gerald</span>, S. J. Adair. Stories of famous</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">songs. pp. xviii., 426. 1898</span><br />
</p>

<p>The style in which the author prints his name in the book should be
adhered to by the cataloguer, though whether printed as Fitz-Gerald,
Fitz Gerald, or Fitzgerald, all are regarded as alike, and arranged
together for alphabetical position in the catalogue.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">McCabe</span>, Joseph. The Iron Cardinal: the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">romance of Richelieu. pp. xii., 389, ports.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1909</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here also the alphabetical order remains the same whether the prefix
is spelled Mac, Mc, or M', this name being arranged as if Maccabe. As
the illustrations to the book consist exclusively of portraits, this
is stated by "ports." instead of "illus." given with the collation. If
the illustrations consist of portraits, pictures, and maps, they are
separately named, as shown in the "St. John" entry below.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ap John</span>, Lewis. William Ewart Gladstone: his</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">life and times. pp. 329, port. 1887</span><br />
</p>

<p>The preliminary pages in this book are marked i. to xvi., and the
succeeding pages 17 to 329, and these are given as above instead of as
pp. xvi., 313.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">O'Grady</span>, Standish. The story of Ireland.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">pp. viii., 214. 1894</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Watkins. pp. xxiv., 319, port., illus., map.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1893</span><br />
</p>

<p>The author's name in this entry is according to the title-page, but a
full catalogue will either give it in full&mdash;Charles William George St.
John&mdash;or with initials, as Charles W. G. St. John.</p>

<p>In the sorting of this and similar entries for alphabetical order,
the procedure of taking the prefix as part of, and one with, the name
following does not apply. The others were regarded as Fitzg, Macc,
Apj, and Obr respectively, but in this case the "St.," besides being
taken as "Saint" in full, stands isolated from the rest of the name,
when it falls into place among all names with a similar prefix and then
in the alphabetical order of the main name. Accordingly St. John, or
Saint-Simon, or Saint-Yves come <em>before</em> Sainta or Sainte-Beuve.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, these books may be completed for the
dictionary catalogue and assigned their places in the classified.</p>

<p>The title "The Iron Cardinal" must be so given, and not as "The iron

<p>In arranging the order it is the correct and better plan to put the
books <em>by</em> a person before those <em>upon</em> him, and it is an advantage to
print the latter in smaller type. The books in the extract from the
Manchester catalogue given on pages <a href="#Page_11">11</a> and <a href="#Page_12">12</a> would be better arranged
in this order:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> (W. E.) Gleanings of past years.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Homer.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Character of.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Essay on, by Brown.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This meagre, telegraphese style of catalogue can never be satisfactory,
so it is not surprising to learn that Mr. C. W. Sutton, the Manchester
Librarian, has superseded it by the classified form.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Ireland</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;"><em>History.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O'Grady, S. The story of Ireland. 1894</span><br />

<p>There is no occasion to give a title-entry for any of these books as
they are adequately catalogued as shown. It may be assumed that any
person who wants them will remember either the authors' names or the
subjects. To give entries under "Stories," "Iron Cardinal," "Story of
Ireland," "Short sketches," would be both futile and wasteful.</p>

<p>In the classified catalogue the main-entries given above would
be numbered and arranged, the book on songs, 821.04 (English
Literature&mdash;Poetry&mdash;Lyric, Ballads), Richelieu as 923.2 (Biography
of Sociology&mdash;Statesmen)&mdash;rather than 922.2 (Biography of
Religion&mdash;Cardinals)&mdash;and the Gladstone would be the same number,
923.2. It is a convenience in the case of biographies in a classified
catalogue to lead off with, and arrange by, the name of the subject of
the biography, in which case the entries are changed to this form:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>923.2 Biography of Sociology&mdash;Statesmen.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Gladstone, William Ewart: his life and times,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">by Lewis Ap John. pp. 329, port. 1887</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Richelieu, Cardinal. The Iron Cardinal, by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Joseph McCabe. pp. xii., 389, ports.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1909</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is still more convenient to throw all the works of biography into a
single alphabet of the names of the subjects without any sub-division.
This enables the consulter of the catalogue to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> a biography
without having to stop and consider whether the person was a cardinal
or a statesman.</p>

<p>The story of Ireland is 941.5 (History&mdash;Ireland), it being a
general history, and not one upon a particular period. The book
on the Highlands deals with the fish, birds, and animals, and is
therefore allocated to 591.941 (Science&mdash;Zoology&mdash;Geographical
Distribution&mdash;Scotland).</p>

<p>The index entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fitz-Gerald, S. J. A. Famous songs. 821.04</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Songs and Ballads (Literature) 821.04</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">McCabe, J. Iron Cardinal (Richelieu) 923.2</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Richelieu, Cardinal, 923.2</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ap John, L. Gladstone, 923.2</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gladstone, William E. (biographies) 923.2</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O'Grady, S. Story of Ireland, 941.5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ireland (History), 941.5</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">St. John, C. Wild sports of the Highlands, 591.941</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scotland (Zoology), 591.941</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Highlands, Scottish (Zoology), 591.941</span><br />
</p>

<p>Other prefixes, mostly of foreign origin, as De, De la, Le, Van, become
the entry-word when attached to British surnames, as in the following
examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">De Morgan</span>, William. Alice-for-Short.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">De la Warr</span>, Constance, Countess. A twice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">crowned queen: Anne of Brittany. 1906</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Le Feuvre</span>, Amy. A bit of rough road.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Van Dyke</span>, Henry. The blue flower.</span><br />
</p>

<p>All these are alphabetized as if the prefixes were part of the names
following, as Demor, Delawa, Lefeu, Vandyke.</p>

<p>The illustrative entries worked out from this point onwards will be
curtailed to the limits of an average or short-entry catalogue, upon
the supposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tion that most of those who use this book will require
compressed entries, the style for full-entry catalogues having been
already sufficiently indicated. It is easier to give entries in full
than to condense them without the loss of any information of moment.
In the following pages an endeavour will be made to show reasonable
condensation of entries or other economies that may be effected and
adopted. Putting this into practice, it will be observed that the
collation has been left out of these entries, and that the dates of
publication are not given in three of them. This latter omission
is because they are works of fiction, and books in this class of
literature are frequently worn out in popular libraries. The editions
replacing them are seldom of the same date, therefore it serves no
particular purpose to give the dates; the great majority of persons
wanting such books are not in the least concerned as to when the book
was published, unless it be that it is the "latest out."</p>

<p>The title-entries for these same three books are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Alice-for-Short. De Morgan, W.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bit of rough road, A. Le Feuvre, A.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blue flower, The. Van Dyke, W.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is often a puzzle where properly to introduce the articles a, an,
and the, in titles turned about to bring the word following into place;
under no circumstances should entries be given under the articles.
Generally they fall into place to read easily and correctly if brought
in before the possessive or at the end. Guidance must be largely a
matter of sight or sound, as no definite rule can be laid down. It is
incorrect to omit them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> altogether, because the sense of the title
is often changed or spoiled. Under the author-entry the articles
should be left in their place, as shown, and not twisted about, as is
occasionally seen, after this fashion.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Deeping</span>, Warwick. Bertrand of Brittany.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Lame Englishman, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Red Saint, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Woman's war, A.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Under the author-entry the books are placed in alphabetical order by
the word following the article. Some rules recommend that this be
emphasised by the use of a capital initial to it, in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Deeping</span>, Warwick. Bertrand of Brittany.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The Lame Englishman.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The Red saint.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; A Woman's war.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This point is further referred to and illustrated in Chapter XII.</p>

<p>Every article when part of a title (apart from the initial one) is
taken into account for alphabetising purposes, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Story of a play.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Story of Aline.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Story of an African farm.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Story of Leah.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Story of the Gadsbys.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The historical biography yet remains for attention and requires a
title-as-subject entry.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Anne of Brittany. A twice crowned queen. De</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">la Warr, Countess. 1906</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>A title-entry may be given if desired, but it cannot be said to be of
much use.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Twice crowned queen, A: Anne of Brittany. De</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">la Warr, Countess. 1906</span><br />
</p>

<p>For the classified catalogue the works of fiction, in a "free library"
at any rate, will hardly be marked 823 (Literature&mdash;English Fiction),
but will be treated as a class apart; all the entries being arranged
alphabetically by author's names, not by the periods in which the books
were written, or the nationalities of the authors. It is true there are
other possibilities in arranging works of fiction in the classified
catalogue, though they introduce an element of obscurity and hinder
ready reference. Historical fiction can be kept apart and arranged
under the countries and periods, or the idea can be carried further and
the books sub-divided under such headings as Human Careers, Adventures
Abroad, America, English Life, Irish Life, Scottish Life, Short Stories
and Sketches, Detectives and Crime. It is conceivable that there are
people who would appreciate a division of this kind, though it would
not suit the general convenience. To bring all the works of fiction
together under a heading "Novels" in the dictionary catalogue, as said
previously, is foreign to its nature, and should not be attempted.</p>

<p>The foregoing illustrations were examples of Anglicized foreign
prefixes. When the prefixes are to genuine foreign names they require
careful consideration and varying treatment according to their
character. If "De" is part of a name undoubtedly French, it is not
the entry word, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> name which follows or precedes it. If a
prefix embodies the definite article in it, as "Du," then that is the
entry-word, whether the name be English or French, so also is the
definite article of "de la", as shown in the de la Br&egrave;te item below.
The above points are all illustrated in the following examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, Louis d'. Le sabre du notaire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Maupassant</span>, Guy de. Fort comme la mort.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Du Boisgobey</span>, Fortun&eacute;. La loge sanglante.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">La Br&egrave;te</span>, Jean de. Mon oncle et mon cur&eacute;.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Le Roux</span>, Hugues. Le fils &agrave; papa.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the prefix is embodied as part of the surname, then the whole name
is regarded as a single one, and comes under the ordinary rule. It is
as well to give examples of these also.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Decourcelle</span>, A. Un homme d'argent.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Delaborde</span>, Vicomte Henri. La gravure: pr&eacute;cis</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&eacute;l&eacute;mentaire. [1882]</span><br />
</p>

<p>All the above are works of fiction, the last excepted, and therefore
receive the usual first-word title-entries in the dictionary catalogue,
the rules governing the use of the article remaining the same for
foreign fiction. To prevent misunderstanding, the correct form for such
entries is here shown</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sabre, Le, du notaire. Harcourt, L. d'.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fort comme la mort. Maupassant, G. de.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Loge sanglante, La. Du Boisgobey, F.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mon oncle et mon cur&eacute;. La Br&egrave;te, J. de.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fils &agrave; papa, Le. Le Roux, H.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Homme d'argent, Un. Decourcelle, A.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Whatever economy may be effected by leaving out the articles in
English titles, it is better and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> correct not to attempt it in
French. The last of the books is on engraving, which word becomes the
subject-heading, as under no circumstances should the name of any
subject be given in any form but English in the catalogue unless, as
happens in remote cases, there is no equivalent in English for the
subject. Accordingly the entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Engraving</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Delaborde, Vicomte H. La gravure. [1882]</span><br />
</p>

<p>The instruction that when the definite article is a prefix, or part
of a prefix, to a name it becomes the entry word must not be blindly
followed in all cases, as there are exceptions. If it were the
middle part (conjunction) of a double name, for example, it is not
the entry-word. To name some instances of this Viollet-le-Duc is so
entered, and not as Le Duc; Verdy du Vernois, and not Du Vernois;
Leconte de Lisle, and not Lisle or De Lisle; and Puvis de Chavannes,
not Chavannes or De Chavannes. Such names require to be treated with
knowledge and discretion.</p>

<p>The inexperienced and the young cataloguer, they are not necessarily
the same, need to exercise due care lest they blunder stupidly if
unwittingly. Perhaps they have a book by, say, J.-H. Rosny le Jeune one
day, and on another one by J.-H. Rosny Ain&eacute;, when it need hardly be
said the entry-names are not Le Jeune or Ain&eacute;, or even Rosny le Jeune
or Rosny Ain&eacute;, but</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rosny</span>, J.-H., <em>ain&eacute;</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Rosny</span>, J.-H., <em>le jeune</em>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and in this order. This note of warning is not unnecessary, as might be
supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Much the same principles govern Italian and Spanish names with
prefixes. In German and Dutch "von" and "van" are not the entry-words,
except in Anglicized names as already shown, or if clearly embodied in
the surname. This latter remark applies to "van," as "von" is seldom,
if ever, so found.</p>

<p>It is customary in entering books by the Greek and Latin classical
authors to adopt the name contained in some modern standard dictionary,
such as Smith's "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography." This is
usually the Latin form, as Virgilius, Homerus, and while it is wise in
the case of a college or other library to follow this, it is better for
a public library to adopt the English style, as Homer, Horace, Ovid,
Pliny, Virgil; at the same time taking care to adhere to the English
forms throughout and to see that all the books are entered under that
adopted, no matter what may be the languages of the various editions.
The author's name as the entry-word must, of course, be turned into
the nominative, and not left in the case in which it appears on the
title-page, though this difficulty does not arise when the English
renderings of the names are chosen.</p>

<p>The following examples are given to elucidate the matter as well as
emphasise it. The title-pages of the four books selected for the
purpose read:&mdash;</p>

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">London Edward Arnold 1909</span><br />
</p>

<p>The first three books have on the preliminary title-pages "The
Parnassus Library of Greek and Latin Texts." To revert to the style of
the full form of entry, these would appear as</p>

</p>

<p>It should be noted that the form of words of the <em>titles</em> of the books
is not altered or amended, the dipthongs in "Trag&#339;di&aelig;" and "&AElig;neis"
being taken from the books, as it is the rule to follow the wording of
a title-page literally, even to the extent of copying obvious mistakes.</p>

<p>References are required from the names of the various editors</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Page</span>, T. E. (<em>Ed.</em>) <em>See</em> Horatius. Virgilius.</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>For "an average catalogue"&mdash;by which is meant one that is intended for
the use of all classes, learned or unlearned&mdash;the popular form of names
is not only more suitable but is more convenient The entries, then,
would be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Horace.</span> Opera; ed. by T. E. Page. (<em>Parnassus</em></span><br />

</p>

<p>The fact that the titles of the books are given in Latin would in
itself be a sufficient indication to the observant that the works are
in the original and not translations.</p>

<p>Apart from the references from editor's names, the above would be the
sole entries in any style of catalogue, as most classical authors,
certainly the Greek and Latin, do not have subject-entries, or anything
corresponding thereto, probably upon the supposition that the contents
of their works are so well known by those who read them that further
entries are uncalled for.</p>

<p>In the classified catalogue most of the classic authors have a specific
place, those above being respectively 874.5 (Literature&mdash;Latin Lyric
Poetry&mdash;Horace), 882.2 (Literature&mdash;Greek Dramatic Poetry&mdash;Sophocles),
873.1 (Literature&mdash;Latin Epic Poetry&mdash;Virgil), and 875.4
(Literature&mdash;Latin Oratory&mdash;Cicero&mdash;Philosophical Works.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>In all subsequent illustrations the position in the Dewey
Classification will be shown by the number attached to each principal
entry, as if it were the shelf ("finding" or "location") number in
the dictionary catalogue, and this will obviate the necessity for any
separate statement relating to the classified catalogue unless it seems
to be required.</p>

<p>Among other names rather puzzling to the cataloguer are those of
persons who have no surnames in the ordinary accepted sense, and
who are known and entered by their Christian or forenames, such as
potentates, popes, saints, and medi&aelig;val writers. Their names will arise
more frequently for subject-entry than as authors, but the style of
entry remains the same in either case.</p>

<p>To take the names of royal personages first, the book chosen is
catalogued as</p>

<p>This would be a sufficiently full entry for most catalogues, yet the
title-page of the first volume reads</p>

<p>The markings in this title denote the division into lines of the
title-page, and are introduced merely to illustrate and explain such
markings when seen in catalogues. They are only used in the case of
rare editions and bibliographical curiosities, or where a very exact
description is wanted.</p>

<p>This book is not allotted to the biography of sociology in the
classified catalogue, but to English History&mdash;Queen Victoria, where
it rightly belongs. The biographies of monarchs are rarely separable
from the histories of their reigns, and these letters are regarded
accordingly.</p>

<p>Whenever a number is used in the titles of monarchs either in the
heading or in transcribing the title of a book, it is given in Roman
numerals, as shown above, and not as "Henry 4th," or even as "William
the Second." The last book requires a further entry under "Russia,"
the "Eastern neighbours" of the title, as the book bears upon German
relations with Russia. It does not need an entry under "Germany," as
all books dealing with a particular monarch or his reign are entered
under his name, as in this instance, and covered by a reference from
the name of the country, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Germany.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> William II.</span><br />
</p>

<p>or more comprehensively</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Germany.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>For the lives of monarchs and the histories of</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>their reigns see their names as</em> William II.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This example affords an opportunity for explaining that in the
catalogues of popular libraries the names of foreign monarchs are
Anglicized, where they admit of it, as shown (William instead of
Wilhelm); that all English monarchs <em>of the same name</em> take
precedence in the order of arrangement; and that the sovereigns with
the same name of a particular country are kept together, and then
arranged in chronological order. The following list demonstrates this
point&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William I., <em>the Conqueror</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William II. (1087-1100).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William III.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William IV.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William I., <em>Emperor of Germany</em> (1861-88).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">William II., <em>Emperor of Germany</em>.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>If considered desirable, the dates of the reigns can be added, as
shown in the second and fifth of these names. This adds a certain
clearness to the entry, though the catalogue is not meant to serve as
an historical dictionary.</p>

<p>The last of the above selection of books is entered</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Marie-Antoinette</strong>, <em>Queen</em>:</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="tdp4">her early youth.</td>

<p>In assigning a place in the classified catalogue for this and similar
books we are faced with the necessity for deciding whether they shall
go in 923.1 (Biography of Sociology&mdash;Chief Rulers, Kings, Queens,
etc.). By the Queen Victoria book it was shown that her letters were
inseparable from the history of her reign, and the same view is taken
of the biographical and other books above, as indicated by the numbers
attached to the entries. If this is considered to be the better and
more useful placing for a book dealing with a monarch, it is a moot
point whether the lives of their consorts are not also to a large
extent contributions to the histories of their periods, and warrant
similar treatment, when this book would be numbered with others on the
reign of Louis XVI. (944.035). A confirmation of this view is found
in the <cite>Subject-Index of the London Library</cite>, where no references
whatever to books on Marie-Antoinette are to be found under her name,
as they are under Louis XVI., though this is no criterion for so
dealing with books catalogued according to the principles laid down in
these pages. In the classified cata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>logue the books can be entered at
944.035, and a reference given to it at 923.1.</p>

<p>Following out the contrary idea, the book upon Prince Henry the
Navigator is not put with the Biography of Princes, but with the
Biography of Travellers, Discovery.</p>

<p>We may take two books upon Popes at this point, though the method of
treatment is virtually the same,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">McCarthy</span>, Justin. Pope Leo XIII. (<em>Public men</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2"><em>of to-day</em>.) 1896</td>
    <td class="tdp1">922.21</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Stephens</span>, W. R. W., <em>Dean</em>. Hildebrand and his</td>

    <td class="tdp2">times. (<em>Epochs of church hist.</em>) map. 1888</td>
    <td class="tdp1">922.21</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Contrary also to the views expressed above, but with as good reason,
these two books are not classified with Religion&mdash;History of the
Roman Catholic Church, but with the Biography of Religion&mdash;Popes. The
subject-entries for the dictionary catalogue are</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Leo XIII.</strong>, <em>Pope</em>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">McCarthy, J. Pope Leo XIII. 1896</td>
    <td class="tdp1">922.21</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><br /><strong>Gregory VII.</strong>, <em>Pope</em>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Stephens, W. R. W. Hildebrand and his</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">times. 1888</td>
    <td class="tdp1">922.21</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This last calls for the reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hildebrand. <em>See</em> Gregory VII., Pope.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The lives of popes, or any other works dealing with them as
individuals, do not need references from their family names, because
these names are merged when the bearers are raised to the pontificate,
and it is unlikely that anyone will look under Pecci for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Leo XIII. Two
useful general references can be added</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Roman Catholic Church.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Popes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Popes.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also the names of Popes as</em> Gregory VII.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Leo XIII.</span><br />
</p>

<p>These references assume that there are books in the catalogue upon the
popes generally.</p>

<p>It will have been observed in passing that both these books, and that
upon Prince Henry the Navigator, in the previous examples, belong to
series, the titles of which are contained in the entries. They are
usually noticed for headings in the dictionary catalogue, as it can
be made to furnish a list of the volumes in a library, belonging to a
series, under the name of the series. As such a list is not intended to
serve as a makeshift form of subject-entry, the first word (articles
excepted) of the title of the series is taken for the entry-word of
the heading, as Heroes of the Nations, Public Men of To-day, Epochs of
Church History, capitals being used to denote that these are special
names. There are three ways of entering under a series heading, viz.,
(1) by the authors' names arranged in alphabetical order, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Heroes of the Nations; ed. by Evelyn Abbott:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Beazley, C. R. Prince Henry the Navigator, 1895</td>
    <td class="tdp1">923.9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>(2) by the subject, especially in a series of a biographical or
personal nature, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Public Men of To-day:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Leo XIII., by J. McCarthy. 1896</td>
    <td class="tdp1">922.21</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>and (3) by the number if the volumes in the series bear a consecutive
number, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>International Scientific Series:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">v. 74. Stebbing, T. R. R. History of crustacea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1898</td>
    <td class="tdp1">595.3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Though allowed for by some of the codes of rules, this latter is a form
not to be commended, as it often involves a search through a long list
to find a particular book. The only possible advantage it has is that
the latest published volumes are to be found at the end of the list,
though this would not apply to new and revised editions if they had the
old volume numbers. When economy of space is of some moment, as it too
often is in the printed catalogues, there being a certain element of
doubt as to the utility of these series entries, they can be dispensed
with, upon the presumption that a person requiring a book will know
either the name of the author or its subject, and the author-entry
reveals if it is one of a series. Whatever likelihood there may be of
a person wishing to read all the books in the Heroes of the Nations
or English Men of Letters Series, it is improbable that anyone will
want to read systematically from volume 1 to 74 of the International
Scientific Series owing to the variety of subjects. The name of the
series should be given in the author-entry even in the brief form
of catalogue. A certain amount of discretion has to be exercised in
giving lists of series, as many publishers' series, like the Pitt Press
Series, Bohn's Libraries, Clarendon Press Series, Everyman's Library,
pass unnoticed. If space can be afforded, it serves some little purpose
towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> indicating the character and scope of books to give the
names of such series in the principal entry. There is no place in the
classified catalogue for separate lists of series.</p>

<p>The saints and similar personages next claim our attention. The entries
will be under their names, and not under "Saint." Examples of the
correct form are</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of canonization does not affect cataloguing so materially
that all persons canonized must be entered under their Christian names,
indeed, the Francis Xavier at least needs the reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Xavier, St. Francis. <em>See</em> Francis Xavier.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Comparatively modern instances, as Sir Thomas More or Bishop John
Fisher&mdash;now the Blessed Thomas More and Blessed John Fisher&mdash;continue
to receive the usual entries under More and Fisher, though they will
not be found under those names in the recently-published <em>Catholic
Encyclopedia</em>, but under Thomas and John respectively. Whatever form of
name may be adopted for the heading, it does not affect the title of
the book, which must be retained as given by the writer, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>More, Sir Thomas</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Bridgett, T. E. Wit and wisdom of Blessed</span><br />

</p>

<p>Friars or other ecclesiastics who drop their surnames and adopt a
religious name happily are not often found among the writers of books
in an average library, though the cataloguer of a theological library
will have to reckon with them. One example will suffice</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

    <td class="tdp1">282</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A reference from Loyson to Hyacinthe is necessary; indeed, in this case
the British Museum Catalogue enters under Loyson with the reference the
reverse way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>In the event of a friar leaving his order, and resuming his "worldly"
name, entry is by that name. A modern instance of this would be</p>

<p>the author having been Father Antony of the Franciscans. No reference
is needed here, and it would only be required in the event of his
having published books under his monastic name.</p>

<p>The first book takes two subject-entries, one under "Roman Catholic
Church" (or "Roman Catholicism"), and the other under "Church of
England," as</p>

<p>There are yet others who are entered by their Christian names, for
lack of another; mostly medi&aelig;val writers, who are, however, usually
distinguished by means of their place, or office, or occupation. It
will suffice to name a few as examples of the type without adding
book-titles to them, viz., Mathew of Paris (Parisiensis); Mathew of
Westminster; Paulus Diaconus; Reginald, Monk of Durham; Thomas &agrave;
Kempis; Walter of Henley; William of Malmesbury.</p>

<p>The results, as worked out, were surprising, and proved the great
difficulty experienced by most in interpreting a title-page. Among the
renderings were these, with others equally incorrect:&mdash;</p>

<p>This had a further entry under "Histori&aelig; Novell&aelig;," William of
Malmesbury being ignored altogether. The punctuation and markings for
the printer are copied as given, and are here printed accordingly.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Truro, William, <em>Bp. of</em>. <em>See</em> Stubbs, William.</span><br />
</p>

<p>As the students were not permitted to use books of reference, the
mistake of placing Bishop Stubbs at Truro instead of Oxford was
pardonable, if not commendable, because it proved that the student had
the knowledge that Chester was not the last bishopric held by Stubbs,
and that, under ordinary circumstances, the correct see would have been
named.</p>

<p>One gave the main-entry under "Malmesbirienses," with references from
"Stubbs" and "Malmesbury, William," and apparently tripping over the
word "libri" added a subject-entry under "Libraries, Monastic." Another
translated the title and marked it for printing in this style</p>

<p>This punctuation, or want of it, as well as the indifferent use of a
parenthesis and bracket, are characteristic of the work of many young
cataloguers. If the "copy" were sent to press without revision and
followed by the printer, the result would be peculiar, to say the least.</p>

<p>In arranging the order of names of the description shown in this

<p>There are other personages who have first-name entries for whom no
definite rule can be laid down other than that which common knowledge
or custom dictates. Certain of the great artists are so entered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Michael Angelo (sometimes given as Michel Angelo and Michelangelo)
as Michael, and not Buonarotti, Raphael not Santi, Rembrandt not
Rhijn. Others are known and always referred to by a sobriquet, or
nickname, which may be the best name for entry, but reference to a good
dictionary of artists, like Bryan's, settles any doubt that may arise.</p>

<p>There are also medi&aelig;val writers of the later period who have what may
be termed special names, by which they are more generally known, but
these names are, as a rule, in such common use that they are unlikely
to present any special difficulty. Erasmus, Grotius, Melancthon are
examples of this class.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

Noblemen. Oriental Names.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Noblemen. Title <em>v.</em> Family Name. Double Subject-Entry.
Oriental Names. Indian Names. Japanese and Chinese Names.
Hebrew Names. Maori Names.</p></div>


<p>Whether noblemen are to be entered in the catalogue as authors or
subjects, the question of entry by title or family name requires
careful consideration. Difference of opinion exists on this point. This
difference is carried into the codes of rules, the Library Association
of this country, curiously enough, advocating entry by the family name,
whereas the American Association, ignoring the republican tradition,
recommends entry under the latest title. This latter recommendation
is certainly far more convenient, because, as a rule, the title is
better remembered, even in cases of recent "creations." Those who
make any large use of the <cite>Dictionary of National Biography</cite> know how
troublesome it is in this respect, invariably entailing two references.
For the catalogues of popular libraries, entry under the latest and
highest title is by far the most convenient and satisfactory, while no
possibility of mistake can arise if references are given in doubtful
cases from the family name to the title, or from an earlier and lower
to a later and higher title.</p>

<p>Some illustrations of such names are the following:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, Earl of. Napoleon: the last phase.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">1904</td>
    <td class="tdp1">944.05</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the rule in the English Code (Joint-Code) this would be given as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Primrose</span>, Archibald P., <em>Earl of Rosebery</em>. Napoleon:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">the last phase. 1904</td>
    <td class="tdp1">944.05</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For the former entry no reference is needed from Primrose to
Rosebery, but in the latter the reference from Primrose is absolutely
indispensable.</p>

<p>The indexer of a lately-published book on dress gets over the
difficulty in a very easy if unsophisticated way by entering under
"Lord," after this manner</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lord Beaconsfield, how dressed, 235</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"&nbsp; &nbsp; Brougham, his check trousers, 104</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is of importance to have the books entered under the highest title
attained at the time the catalogue is published. The two undermentioned
books illustrate this point. The first is described as by "the late
Alexander, Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, Lord Lindsay, Etc.," and the
second as by "Lord Balcarres." We distinguish between them and enter in
this way</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Crawford and Balcarres</span>, Alexander, 25th Earl</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">of. The Earldom of Mar in sunshine and</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">shade during 500 years. 2 v. <em>Edin.</em>, 1882</td>
    <td class="tdp1">923.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Crawford and Balcarres</span>, David, 27th Earl of.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">The evolution of Italian sculpture, illus. 4<sup>o</sup></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">784</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This latter work being published while the author was Lord Balcarres
necessitates the reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Balcarres</span>, Lord. <em>See</em> Crawford and Balcarres,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Earl of.</span><br />
</p>

<p>which will fit any Earl of Crawford who might have published a book
while using the courtesy title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> Lord Balcarres. It may be admitted
that entry by the family name would bring all books together by members
of this particular family, irrespective of the titles under which they
may have written, whether Lord Balcarres, Lord Lindsay, or Earl of
Crawford, but such cases are few.</p>

<p>When the title of a nobleman is adopted for the entry in cases where he
has written books before being raised to the peerage, it is essential
that the reference from his former name be given, particularly if it
differs from the title he has assumed, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Lubbock</span>, Sir John. <em>See</em> Avebury, Lord.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Mitford</span>, A. B. Freeman. <em>See</em> Redesdale, Lord.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If the family name and the title are alike, or almost so, the reference
is seldom necessary, as the two names come near together. Examples
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Courtney of Penwith</span>, Lord (Leonard H. Courtney).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Morley of Blackburn</span>, Lord (John Morley).</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the event of there being many entries under the names of Courtney
and Morley, the references are required. In arranging these names for
order they would, of course, precede those of commoners, irrespective
of the alphabetical order of the secondary parts, that is to say
"Courtney of Penwith, Lord," comes before, say, "Courtney, Abram."</p>

<p>As "exceptions which prove the rule," there are a few noblemen who
are decidedly better known and are always referred to by their family
names, of which two outstanding instances are Francis Bacon (Viscount
St. Albans) and Horace Walpole (Earl of Orford).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject-entries for the three books given above are</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Napoleon I.</strong>, <em>Emperor</em>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Rosebery, Earl of. Napoleon: the last phase.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1904</td>
    <td class="tdp1">944.05</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mar, The Earldom of. Crawford, Earl of. 2 v.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">1882</td>
    <td class="tdp1">923.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><br /><strong>Sculpture</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Crawford, Earl of. The evolution of Italian</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">sculpture. 1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">784</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is no occasion to distinguish between the Earls of Crawford in
the sub-entries except in the very remote possibility of two of them
having written on the same subject.</p>

<p>The book on Italian sculpture raises a very troublesome question in
connection with subject-entries for the dictionary catalogue, namely,
whether double entry is required or not. The youthful beginner may be
told here, as a kind of aside, that there is no <em>third</em> subject to this
book, it has nothing to do with "Evolution" as such. The book is not
upon sculpture as a whole, but upon that subject with a geographical
(or national) limitation, yet the prominence of Italian sculpture in
that art calls for an entry under "Sculpture," as shown above. The
book, moreover, is not specifically upon Italian art, but only upon a
phase of it, yet those who want to study Italian art in all its aspects
must have their attention directed to it. Accordingly we either need an
entry, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Italy</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc"><em>Art.</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Crawford, Earl of. The evolution of Italian</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">sculpture. 1909</td>
    <td class="tdp1">784</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>or the more economical reference:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Italy</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><em>Art.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Sculpture.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When space is a consideration, then the reference will suffice, but
where it can be afforded, double entry is advised. If there are
many entries under such a heading it can be sub-divided to simplify
reference&mdash;divisions as "General," "Greek and Roman," "Italian,"
"British," suggest themselves, though the amount of sub-division
usually depends upon the material to be arranged. The heading need not
necessarily be the geographical one (Italy), as here shown; a term more
direct, say "Italian Art," might be chosen.</p>

<p>In any case a book of this definite character would not be entered
under "Art" in the dictionary catalogue, sculpture being but a branch
of the Fine Arts, as also are painting and architecture. The heading
"Art" then would be reserved for books dealing with art generally,
including all the arts, or, at least, the two principal, painting and
sculpture, which people mostly mean when speaking of art, though in no
case must the valuable guiding reference be omitted</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Art</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Sculpture.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no reason why this heading should not be reserved
for books upon art generally without a qualification, and the books
upon national art be placed under the names of the country concerned,
with a further reference of a comprehensive nature, to this effect</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Art</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Architecture. Painting. Sculpture.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>For the art of particular countries see</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>their names as</em> Greece, Italy, Japan.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Though not quite in the same category, by far the most troublesome
names the cataloguer has to contend with are the Oriental, both of the
far and near East. They are increasingly coming under notice, not only
attached to translations, but to books written in English, and have
to be reckoned with for the catalogues of even comparatively small
libraries. If the cataloguer should stumble in his selection of the
name under which he makes the entry, he has the satisfaction of knowing
that he errs in good company, with the further consolation of believing
that there will be few who know enough to discover his mistake, though
these facts will be no justification, and should only serve to put him
on his guard. In Abdullah Yusuf-Ali's <cite>Life and labour of the people
of India</cite> (1907) we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If Miss Toru Dutt were to come to life again, and had nothing
better to do than go to the British Museum, she would never
be able to trace her own book from the Catalogue. Her name
is to be found neither under Dutt nor under Toru, but as
Tarulata Datta. Mrs. Naidu's name appears under S. as Sarojini
Nayadu. Perhaps some sympathy might be extended to the
Frenchman who never could understand why names were treated
so badly in England; there was one he knew which they wrote
as Marjoribanks and pronounced as <em>Chumley!</em> To be consistent
the British Museum Catalogue ought (especially after the
recent spell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ing crusade) to spell the names of the President
of the United States "R&ocirc;s-felt" and classify it under T as
Theodoros&mdash;Theodore being only a modern corruption of a good
Greek name."</p></div>

<p>This is quoted for what it is worth, though coming as it does from
a native source and from one who can also write in English, it is
entitled to great respect. The following paragraph taken from <cite>The
Westminster Gazette</cite> is helpful in this connection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The usually full telegrams from India during the past week
have furnished several examples of that perpetual puzzle the
proper use of Indian names. Both the home and the Anglo-Indian
Press are apt to stumble, and to an Indian reader their
mistakes must be as amusing as the 'Lord Balfour' and 'Sir
Morley' of certain French newspapers are to us. As a rule, the
blunders occur in reference to Parsee or Bengali names. Roughly
speaking, every Bengali man has three names. The first is his
given name, the second is conventional or honorific, the third
is the patronymic, analogous to an Irish or Scottish clan-name.
For example, Dr. Rash Behari Ghose (who should have been
president of this year's National Congress), Mr. Romesh Chandra
Dutt (the historian and ex-Civil servant), Bepin Chandra Pal
(the well-known agitator). In each case the important names
are the first and third; the second cannot be used without the
first, though in certain forms of address the third is omitted.
Thus, while it is permissible to speak of Dr. Rash Behari,
Reuter is quite wrong with his 'Dr. Behari Ghose.' Similarly,
the <cite>Times</cite> should not speak of 'Mr. Chandra Pal,' nor the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> of 'Babu Banerjea.' We may say 'Bepin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> Babu'
or 'Mr. Pal,' 'Surendra Babu,' or Mr. Banerjea; but it is safer
to give the full names. Parsee names are another matter, and a
more intricate one."</p></div>

<p>We may take a book by way of illustration, and examine it for
cataloguing. The title-page of that chosen reads</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Tarikh-i-Rashidi of Mirza Muhammad Haidar, Dughl&aacute;t. A
history of the Moghuls of Central Asia. An English version
edited, with commentary, notes, and map by N. Elias. The
translation of E. Denison Ross. London, Sampson Low, &amp;c. 1895</p></div>

<p>Upon somewhat general principles&mdash;too general to be always
reliable&mdash;the entry in such names is usually made under the first
name, which in this instance is Mirza, the author being referred to
throughout the preface as Mirza Haidar, though it appears that other
European writers have called him Haidar Mirza. In some parts of Asia
the reversal of the name in this way makes considerable difference;
when "Mirza" leads it means simply "Mr." or "Esq.," but at the end of
the name it is equivalent to "Prince," and is so used only by persons
who belong to a reigning family. As the writer was a prince, his name
could properly be given either way. Mirza being a title and not a name,
cannot be the entry-name, yet it is so entered, with other Mirzas, in
the Catalogue of the London Library. The British Museum enters the name
as "Muhammad Haidar, <em>Dughl&aacute;t</em>." For most libraries an entry to the
following effect will prove sufficient</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">ed. by N. Elias. 1895</td>
    <td class="tdp1">950</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The book from which the paragraph criticising the British Museum
Catalogue was taken will serve as a further example, though it is a
very simple one; the author, apparently appreciating the difficulty
his name presents to Westerns, has given it at the end of the preface
and on the binding as "A. Yusuf-Ali," though it is in full, Abdullah
Yusuf-Ali, on the title-page. This enables us to see that it is correct
to treat the name as if it were an occidental one, and the entry is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Yusuf-Ali</span>, Abdullah. Life and labour of the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">people of India, illus. 1907</span><br />
</p>

<p>For ascertaining the meaning of terms attached to Oriental names, the
"List of Oriental titles and occupations with their signification,"
given in Linderfelt's <cite>Eclectic Card Catalog Rules</cite> already named
is useful. For Indian names such works of reference as Whitworth's
<cite>Anglo-Indian Dictionary</cite>, Beale and Keene's <cite>Oriental Biographical
Dictionary</cite>, and Lethbridge's <cite>Golden Book of India</cite> are serviceable.</p>

<p>Japanese and Chinese names present the same difficulty, though
the books themselves often indicate the correct name for entry,
especially in translations. Works in the original will necessitate
obtaining the aid of an expert, not only for giving the name of the
author and stating the subject with which he deals, but for making
a transliteration or some rendering suitable for a catalogue entry.
On the rare occasions when this is required, there is seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> any
difficulty in obtaining reliable voluntary help. Quite recently the
Chelsea Library obtained the loan of a Japanese manuscript from the
Swedish Royal Library, and a Frenchman translated it into English.</p>

<p>For the present Japanese names are oftener met with than Chinese, not
only attached to translations, but to books written in English and
continental languages, and first name entry is not always the correct
form. To take two examples in illustration</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ideals of the East, with special reference to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">the art of Japan, by Kakasu Okakura. 1903</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A Japanese artist in London, written and illustrated</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by Yoshio Markino. 1910</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the prefaces of these books the writers are referred to as Mr.
Okakura and Mr. Markino respectively, therefore, these names may be
looked upon as corresponding to, although not actually the same as, the
family name in European usage, and the entries are given accordingly</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

<p>There is every probability that had these books been published in Japan
the names of the authors would have been reversed upon the title-pages,
as "Okakura Kakasu" and "Markino Yoshio," but that fact does not
involve any necessity for references in an English catalogue.</p>

<p>Chinese names may need quite different treatment, and, failing any clue
as to the correct name for entry, the first given should be taken. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
following will not only illustrate this point, but serve to demonstrate
the method of condensing a title which in full is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is more advertisement than title-page, and the cataloguer renders
it all as simply as possible in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, these books by Orientals must have
subject-entries to complete them. The first is a history of the
Mongols, and not of the Mohammedan Empire in India as the title might
seem to imply, therefore the entry is</p>

<p>Where names have become so much adapted to the Western style, as the
above two, it might be possible to reduce them to "Okakura, K." and
"Markino, Y.", though the full form is preferable, even in sub-entries.</p>

<p>The Chinese work being by the founder of the religion known as
"Taoism," receives an entry accordingly</p>

</p>

<p>Hebrew names, those of Jewish rabbis especially, come up occasionally
for entry, but a general recommendation to consult the <cite>Jewish
Encyclopedia</cite> (12 v. 1901-6) will suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many other forms of foreign names, but the foregoing
remarks and illustrations will enable the cataloguer to see that no
definite rule governing all forms of names, even those of a particular
nationality, can be laid down. For instance, to go further afield
in the world, no code gives any guidance for Maori names, yet it
is conceivable that people of this race may yet figure as authors
of English books, even if only sermons, as a number of them are
clergymen of the Church of England. So far as Crockford's <cite>Clerical
Directory</cite> serves as a guide, their names appear mostly under "Te," as
Te Awekotuku, Te Hana, Te Ngara, Te Raro, but there are no names of
the kind in the British Museum Catalogue under "Te," and, therefore,
the careful cataloguer will take heed, when the occasion arises, to
ascertain exactly the really important and distinguishing part of the
name, and enter accordingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

Pseudonyms. Married Women.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Pseudonyms <em>v.</em> Real Names. The Better-known Name. Methods
of Marking Pseudonyms. Writers who use Two Names.
Phrase-Pseudonyms. Specific Entry. Repetition Dashes.
Use of Capitals for Emphasis. Women's Names Changed by
Marriage. Anonymous Books. The Discovery of Authors of
Anonymous Books. "By the Author of&mdash;&mdash;." Names consisting

<p>The cataloguer's troubles do not end when the, to him, vexatious
styles of names referred to in the previous pages are settled. He has
to decide for himself the somewhat difficult question of entry under
pseudonyms or real names when known, or under married or maiden names
when both have been used by women authors.</p>

<p>These classes come into the same division as changed names, though the
standard codes of rules make different recommendations, some to enter
by the real name, others by the pseudonym, but most are in favour of
the latter.</p>

<p>The A.L.A. and L.A. Joint-Code rule is to "enter under the pseudonym
of a writer when the real name is not known," which is another way of
saying "enter under the real name when known."</p>

<p>A great deal of attention has from time to time been paid to this
subject by librarians. Some years ago the whole tendency was to hunt
in all places, likely or unlikely, in the hope of discovering the
real name of an author who used a pseudonym, and, when the search
was successful, of getting it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> print as soon as possible. A
librarian thereby may have scored by being ahead of his fellows with
the information, and the user of the catalogue may have acquired
knowledge, though possibly he did not want it, especially if it
involved looking up two references instead of one. The tendency is
now somewhat in the other direction, and it may safely be said that,
except for some excellent reason, the entries should be given under
the pseudonym, rules or no rules. It may reasonably be contended that
the better-known, whether it be the pseudonym or the real name, is the
right one for the entry, as being the more reasonable and satisfactory.
Should there be any doubt which is the better known, then it is "a
mistake on the right side" to enter under the real name of the author.</p>

<p>There is a little variation in the styles of printing such entries in a
catalogue. Some give them after this manner</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Annunzio</span>, Gabriele d', <em>pseud.</em> (i.e. Gaetano Rampagnetto).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The triumph of death.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Others print the assumed name in italics, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>Dale, Darley</em>, pseud. (Francesca M. Steele).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Seven sons; or, the story of Malcolm and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">his brothers.</span><br />
</p>

<p>while others put it shorter still, without any loss of clearness as to
meaning</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">France</span>, Anatole" (A. Fran&ccedil;ois Thibault.) Le</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">livre de mon ami.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In none of these cases is it deemed necessary, at least in an average
catalogue, to refer from the real name to the pseudonym, for the reason
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> not one person in a thousand would think of looking under the
real names of these authors. In the catalogues of large and important
libraries, particularly reference libraries, these references can be
given, as a matter of course, according to the rules, otherwise there
is the risk of the same author appearing in two places under different
names. It is well, on principle, to take a rooted objection to this,
though under special circumstances it is conceivable that it might be
no great disadvantage. Take a modern instance</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Danby</span>, Frank. Pigs in clover.</span><br />
</p>

<p>which is by Julia Frankau, the author of two important books&mdash;one
on colour prints and the other on the mezzotinto engraver, J. R.
Smith&mdash;both published under her real name. These books are so far
apart in character from her novels that both names might very well be
used in the catalogue. In the classified catalogue the use of the two
names would not matter, but in the dictionary catalogue it requires
consideration. Again, there is little likelihood of these books all
appearing in the same catalogue; the lending library would not have the
books on prints, and the reference or other special library which might
contain them would hardly have the novels. This illustration is named
simply to show the consideration that can be given to a case of the
kind. It does not really end here, because there is always the chance
of the author writing more fiction under her real name. Remembering
this, and the fact that she has already published books under her
proper name, the reference becomes necessary for safety in the future.
That is to say, for the novel the reference is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> from Frankau to
the pseudonym until the time comes to reverse the process.</p>

<p>There are several similar instances where the books, though widely
differing in character, are none the less likely to appear in the same
catalogue. The writings of the late Rev. John M. Watson may be cited
as a case in point, those on religious subjects being published under
his real name, and his stories under the pseudonym of "Ian Maclaren." A
present-day example of the same thing is the book</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Hannay</span>, James O. The spirit and origin of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Christian monasticism. 1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">271</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>which is by the same author who writes novels under the pseudonym of
"George A. Birmingham." In the case of a library publishing a separate
catalogue of fiction there can be no objection to following the course
already recommended, by entering under the pseudonym</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Birmingham</span>, George A." (Jas. O. Hannay).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The red hand of Ulster.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If there is no separate catalogue of fiction, the author's books must
all be brought together, when it is inevitable that the real name,
rather than the fictitious, be taken for all entries. Here arises the
problem whether the pseudonym is to be attached to the entry for the
book on monasticism or limited to the books written under the assumed
name. It is helpful to mark the distinction in this way</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Hannay</span>, Jas. O. The spirit and origin of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Christian monasticism. 1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">271</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&mdash; ("Geo. A. Birmingham"). The red hand of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Ulster.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>not overlooking the essential reference</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Birmingham</span>, George A." <em>See</em> Hannay, Jas. O.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>There is at least one example of an author publishing works of fiction
under both his real name and a pseudonym, viz., J. E. Preston Muddock,
who writes some stories under his true name, and his detective stories
under that of "Dick Donovan." The right course to pursue in this case
is to enter all under Muddock. Unless there is strong objection to
placing books by one writer in two places, there is no reason why the
separate entries should not appear under both names. While introduced
here to show a possible method of treatment, it must not be taken as
recommended.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Muddock, J. E. P.</span> The dead man's secret.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The lost laird.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Donovan, Dick.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Donovan</span>, Dick" (J. E. P. Muddock). Tales of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">terror.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The sin of Preaching Jim.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Muddock, J. E. P.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the name of an author is known to be, or, from its nature, is
obviously a pseudonym, it is better given in inverted commas, or
whatever other style is adopted to mark a pseudonym, whether the
real name be known or not. Such names are "Skelton Kuppord," "Walker
Miles," "Home Counties," "Daniel Chaucer." A pseudonym which consists
of a phrase can rarely be regarded as a name, and it is wiser to treat
the book as if it were anonymous, after the manner referred to later,
bringing the phrase-pseudonym into the title-entry in this way</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Kruger's secret service, by One who was in it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">1900</td>
    <td class="tdp1">968</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>To enter under "One who was in it" would be useless as well as
wasteful. A similar example is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The life of a prig, by One. 1886</span><br />
</p>

<p>when the entry under "One" would be equally futile and absurd. So also
would be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The danger of spiritualism, by a Member of the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Society for Psychical Research. 1901</span><br />
</p>

<p>if entered under "Member." The first of these two receives a
title-entry, which is a recognition of the pseudonym, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Prig, The life of a, by One. 1886</span><br />
</p>

<p>In these examples the non-recognition of the pseudonym is due to the
fact that its application is confined to a particular instance or a
particular book. This recommendation for treating phrase-pseudonyms
must be carefully considered in relation to the books produced by the
users. Those who write regularly and publish several works under such
pseudonyms must be recognised&mdash;as witness the case of "A Son of the
Marshes."</p>

<p>At this point the arrangement of working out the foregoing entries in
full may be continued. The first is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Monasticism</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Hannay, J. O. The spirit, &amp;c., of Christian</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">monasticism. 1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">271</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>or, in the event of there being but a single work on the subject</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Monasticism, Christian, The spirit, &amp;c., of.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Hannay, J. O. 1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">271</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is a separate fiction catalogue or class-list, the entry for
the novel by the same author is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Red hand of Ulster, The. Birmingham, G. A.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When the entries are embodied in the dictionary catalogue, and the real
name of the author is taken for the main-entry, the title-entry becomes</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Red hand of Ulster, The. Hannay, J. O.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It must be admitted that this might puzzle a person who remembers the
title of the book and could recognise it by the name of the author, but
would fail to identify Hannay with Birmingham. The entry must, all the
same, be given in this form to guide to the name of "Hannay," where
the principal entry is to be found. The same remark equally applies to
the title-entries requisite for Mr. Muddock's books, if they are all
entered under "Muddock" in orthodox fashion and not divided. If divided
the entries would be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dead man's secret, The. Muddock, J. E. P.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lost laird, The. Muddock, J. E. P.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tales of terror. Donovan, D.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sin, The, of Preaching Jim. Donovan, D.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The "Kruger" book comes under some such heading as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Boers, The, and Boer Wars</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Kruger's secret service, by One who was in it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1900</td>
    <td class="tdp1">968</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>with references thereto from "Africa, South," "Transvaal, The," and
"Orange Free State."</p>

<p>At the risk of labouring the point&mdash;an important one which will bear
emphasis&mdash;the last book affords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> an opportunity for again demonstrating
the handling of a book for specific subject-entry in the dictionary
catalogue. This form of entry requires that books bearing upon the
Boer Wars, the French Revolution, the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny,
the Gunpowder Plot, the American Revolution, or any other historical
happening to which a definite name is attached, shall be entered under
such specific name, not under the name of the country or countries
concerned. It might be possible to evade this by giving a reference
from the name of the event to the name of the country, but it is
against the principles of the dictionary catalogue. The matter has
to be reasoned out like this: a history of the last Boer War is not
a history of South Africa, is not even a history of the Transvaal or
of the Orange Free State, although it terminated the existence of the
republics of those states. Similarly a history of the Crimean War is
not a history of Russia, and has as much to do with Turkey, to say
nothing of this country or of France; a history of the Franco-German
War is neither a history of France nor of Germany, but merely a
detached epoch in the history of both countries, however much it had
to do with the founding of the present German Empire and the fall of
the French Empire. Therefore, literal exactness requires, as already
stated, that entry be made under the names whereby such events are
known with <em>See also</em> references thereto from the names of the
countries involved. It is also required that the term chosen for the
heading shall be definite and not general. If the heading, say, of
"Civil War" were taken in a British catalogue for books upon the great
Civil War of the 17th century, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> would be incorrect, because too
inclusive, as books upon civil war in the abstract or on civil wars
generally or in any country, as the Civil War between North and South
in America, could all be grouped under it, therefore the heading must
be "earmarked" in some way to show what particular civil war is meant,
say, "Civil War, The Great," or "Civil War and Commonwealth," or even
"Civil War, The." The addition of the definite article to the last
heading serves to show that the Puritan revolution is meant, though it
would not give the same meaning in an American catalogue. In this way
headings to be adopted are reasoned out before being decided upon.</p>

<p>The "Life of a prig" is already sufficiently disposed of, though it is
not a story, but is more or less in the nature of a satire recounting
the troubles of an Oxford man, uncertain as to whether he should belong
to the Anglican or Roman Church. It is marked for the classified
catalogue as a satire of the late Victorian period. This is a type of
book that is the bane of the cataloguer's life, and he is not to be
blamed if he summarily disposes of it under any heading or title that
does not altogether relegate it to obscurity. The last is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Spiritualism</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Dangers, The, of spiritualism, by a Member</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">of the Society for Psychical Research.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1901</td>
    <td class="tdp1">133.9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>and is the sole entry for this book.</p>

<p>Attention may here be directed to two points arising in connection
with some of the above entries. It will be noticed that in the Hannay
entry a "repetition dash" (&mdash;) has been given in lieu of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> the name for
the second entry, as it would be for all subsequent entries under the
same name. To make use of this dash for any other purpose is dangerous,
and should be avoided. The old-fashioned custom of using it to save
repeating words in the title-entries, led to the well-known catalogue
jokes:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mill on Liberty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; &mdash; the Floss.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lead, kindly Light.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Silver and.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and others equally ridiculous. Every word omitted was indicated by a
separate dash, after this manner</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three Men in a Boat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; &mdash; on the Bummel.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Toilers of the Field.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Sea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Told by the Colonel.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Death's Head.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that in all the above cases no dashes
were required; every word should have been given, both for the sake of
understanding and appearance.</p>

<p>The second point relates to the recommendation, already referred to,
that the word following the article in titles whereby the entries are
alphabetized should have a capital letter, and also that one should be
given to the first word of an alternative title. Nothing can be said
against these proposals unless it is that they give certain words an
undue prominence. The books of J. E. P. Muddock serve admirably as
illustrations:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Muddock</span>, J. E. P. The Dead man's secret; or,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">The valley of gold.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The Lost laird.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The Man from Manchester.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This, however, resolves itself more into a question of taste than of
expediency.</p>

<p>In the same category as pseudonyms come the women who, in changing
their names by marriage, perhaps more than once, have written under all
forms of their names&mdash;"aggravating ladies" as they have been called.
At times they are better known by the names of their husbands, as
Mrs. Mark Pattison, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Mrs. Sidney Webb. It would be
injudicious to adopt a fixed rule to cover all cases of this kind. The
best-known name recommendation again applies, although the rule usually
laid down is to enter a married woman under whatever name she first
used as an author, with references thereto from her later names. In
some cases this is quite a safe and convenient rule, while in others it
involves looking in two places. To state a case, people are now more
familiar with the works of Mrs. Sidney Webb under that name than under
her maiden name of Beatrice Potter. If entry were made under Potter it
would in any case necessitate a reference to Webb for those books which
she had written jointly with her husband. Therefore, it being admitted
that the better-known name, also the more correct, is that of Webb, the
entries are so given, with the reference from Potter, i.e.,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Webb</span>, Beatrice (Potter). The co-operative movement</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">in Great Britain. 1891</td>
    <td class="tdp1">334</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&mdash; (<em>joint-author.</em>) <em>See also</em> Webb, Sidney.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Potter</span>, Beatrice. <em>See</em> Webb, Beatrice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">1894</td>
    <td class="tdp1">331.88</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For order of arrangement it will be noticed that books written by
Sidney Webb alone precede those written by him as a joint-author,
with his name in the leading place. If the last-named book had been
published as "by Beatrice and Sidney Webb" the entry would, as a matter
of course, be under Mrs. Webb's name, her book on co-operation coming
before it. The Workman illustration given in Chapter V. should be
considered in this connection. Another, and rather different difficulty
of the kind, is when a man and his wife have collaborated and published
with the wife's maiden name in the leading place. If the lady has
written other books before marriage and continues to use her maiden
name on books written by herself, it settles the matter sufficiently to
warrant entry under the maiden name, as</p>

<p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject-entries for the foregoing books are</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">Great Britain. 1891</td>
    <td class="tdp1">334</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It would be incorrect, for the sake of economy, to omit the definite
article in this, as it somewhat alters the sense. At times it can be
left out without any risk of changing the meaning, as in the book on
trades unions below. Some cataloguers make a feature of giving the
Christian name in full in subordinate entries if the author is a woman.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Socialism</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Webb, S. Socialism in England. 1901 335.1</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1894</td>
    <td class="tdp1">331.88</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A reference is needed to assist towards that coordination between the
subject-entries of a catalogue serving to bring its related parts
together, and is helpful by way of suggestion to the inquirer when
using it.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Labour</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Trades Unions.</span><br />
</p>

<p>There can be no objection in the above instance, or in those of Mrs.
Humphry Ward and other ladies <em>well known</em> and commonly spoken of by
their husband's names, to giving, if desired, the entries under those
names, provided the usual references are furnished.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Webb</span>, Beatrice. <em>See</em> Webb, Mrs. Sidney.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Ward</span>, Mary A. <em>See</em> Ward, Mrs. Humphry.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>It would, however, be possible to dispense with the references
altogether, if only a comparatively small number of entries under Webb
or Ward appear in the catalogue.</p>

<p>To show the difficulty experienced by cataloguers in keeping pace with
ladies who change their names by marriage, it may be mentioned that
even a well-known author like the late Lady Dilke, who was Mrs. Mark
Pattison, can be found in good catalogues placed accidentally under
both names. On the other hand it is as well to be quite sure when
following up the changed names of women authors. The London Library
and some lesser catalogues have confused Anne Manning and Mrs. A. M.
Rathbone, with the result that books are amalgamated erroneously under
one name though written by different persons. In other catalogues of
minor importance "George Eliot" has figured as Mrs. G. H. Lewes and
Marie Corelli as Marion Mackay.</p>

<p>Although recommended by some rules, there is no real necessity for
giving references from the married names of writers of the importance
of "George Eliot" or Charlotte Bront&euml;, as it is improbable that anyone
would refer to "Cross" or "Nicholls" for these authors.</p>

<p>This treatment of women authors may be summed up by repeating the
recommendation "use the best-known name in all cases"&mdash;if the lady
writes under her maiden name and is mostly known thereby, that is the
name to use; if by her married name, then use that.</p>

<p>If she has been married more than once and written under all forms of
her name (of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> examples are A. Mary F. Robinson, who was Madame
Duclaux and then Madame Darmesteter, and Mrs. Aubrey Le Blond, n&eacute;e
Whitshed, formerly Mrs. Fred. Burnaby and Mrs. Main) then, again, the
best-known (in these cases Robinson and Le Blond) are the right ones
to use, not neglecting the references from the others. If a writer has
consistently used a pseudonym, that, again, is the best to adopt for
the entry. For example, there is a Spanish novelist, known as "Fernan
Caballero," who, surviving three husbands, resumed her maiden name. In
her case it is not worth while searching for or discussing which of her
names should be chosen, that by which she is universally known being
undoubtedly the best.</p>

<p>Books published anonymously&mdash;that is where the authors' names are
not upon the title-pages, and no clue to them is to be found in the
books&mdash;are more annoying to the cataloguer than pseudonymous works. At
times a preface or a dedication in a book may bear the author's name or
initials, or there may be something serving to reveal his identity in
the text, and such evidence must be searched for. In the event of the
book itself yielding no help, then the customary sources of information
are turned to, the best for British cataloguers being Halkett and
Laing's <cite>Dictionary of the Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature of
Great Britain</cite> (though this is not absolutely reliable). The British
Museum, London Library, or other important catalogues at command should
be consulted, particularly the catalogues of the place from which the
book comes, as the wanted information may be known locally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> For French
books Barbier's <cite>Dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes</cite> is useful.</p>

<p>The method of cataloguing an anonymous book may be shown here. The
title-page of that chosen reads</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The failure of Lord Curzon: a study in "imperialism": an open
letter to the Earl of Rosebery, by "Twenty-eight years in
India." 1903</p></div>

<p>The preface opens with a statement that the writer has adopted
anonymity though quite aware that it is the thinnest of screens if
there is any wish to pierce behind it, and he goes on to say that
a twenty-eight years' acquaintance with India, etc., suggests some
knowledge of the matter he discusses, thus showing that "Twenty-eight
years in India" is not the title of another book, but a species of
pseudonym. If this "thinnest of screens" cannot be penetrated, and the
mere suggestion that it can should serve to put the cataloguer on his
mettle, then there are two ways of entering the book regarding it as
strictly anonymous. One is to enter uniformly by the first word of the
title not an article as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Failure, The, of Lord Curzon: a study in "imperialism,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">by "Twenty-eight years in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">India." 1903</span><br />
</p>

<p>The better way to enter anonymous books when concerned with particular
persons or places is under the names of such persons or places,
provided they are named on the title-pages, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Curzon of Kedleston, Lord. The failure of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lord Curzon: a study in "imperialism," by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Twenty-eight years in India." 1903</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a sufficient entry, as any person wanting the book could not
fail to remember that it related to Lord Curzon unless he thought
of Indian administration, which would be the subject-entry for it.
Another method, much the same in principle, is to enter under the first
substantive in the title.</p>

<p>If the name of the author is ascertained later and with certainty, as
this was, the entry must be altered accordingly</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">O'Donnell</span>, C. J. The failure of Lord Curzon:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">a study in "imperialism," by "Twenty-eight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">years in India." 1903 354.54</span><br />
</p>

<p>When literal exactness is the custom of the library the author's name
as above would be enclosed in brackets to show that it is an addition
made by the cataloguer under the rule previously alluded to. If that is
the method decided upon for entering anonymous books, the first-word
entry is still retained, with the author's name added.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Failure, The, of Lord Curzon: a study in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"imperialism," by "Twenty-eight years in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">India" [C. J. O'Donnell.] 1903 354.54</span><br />
</p>

<p>With the author's name revealed the entry under Lord Curzon becomes a
subject-entry</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Curzon of Kedleston</strong>, <em>Lord</em>:</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">354.54</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The author's name was obtained from a newspaper paragraph some months
after the publication of the book, and verified before use. If the
paragraph had been of the speculative nature of the following, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
would have been wiser to ignore it, and wait for something more definite</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The mention of Mr. Jack London suggests an interesting
question of authorship. There has been some discussion about
the anonymous author of the lately published 'Kempton Wace
Letters.' Now, in that book we find the superscription, 'The
Ridge, Berkeley, California'; and we can think of only three
writers who talk about California&mdash;'Gertrude Atherton,' Miss
Beatrice Harraden, and Mr. Jack London. The style of the
'Kempton Wace Letters' is so remote from that of the two
first-named, and on the other hand is so much like that of the
young Californian, that we venture to suggest Mr. London as the
author."</p></div>

<p>Paragraphs of this kind always appeal to the careful cataloguer, and
keep his mind on the alert until the point is settled one way or other.
One so obviously inspired as the following is authoritative enough for
use</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sir Charles Eliot, whose authorship of the important work on
the Near East, 'Turkey in Europe,' by 'Odysseus,' is now an
open secret, has produced in 'The East Africa Protectorate,' to
be published by Mr. Edward Arnold on March 8th, an account of
the country of which he recently resigned the Commissionership."</p></div>

<p>There is another method of cataloguing anonymous books sometimes
seen, viz., bringing them all together under a heading "Anon." It
has nothing to commend it unless it be the apparent advantage of
having all anonymous books in one place. This is somewhat akin to the
practice of grouping all thin books under the comprehensive heading
"Pamphlets"&mdash;comprehensive because if the idea is carried out logically
only two headings are required, "Pamphlets" and "Books."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Another class of anonymous books is that in which they are stated to
be "By the Author of" some other book which is named. These are dealt
with in the same way as any other anonymous books, except that it is
convenient to furnish a list of the books that a library possesses
written by such an author, this list being given under the title of the
best-known book, if such can be distinguished&mdash;if not, the one most
frequently named on the title-pages of the rest of the books is taken,
when references can be given from the others. Examples are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Laddie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Miss Toosey's mission.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Tip cat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Miss Toosey's mission, by the Author of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Laddie."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Laddie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If italics are preferred to quotation marks, the style will be instead</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tip cat, by the Author of <em>Laddie</em>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Laddie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Instead of grouping the books under "Laddie," a covering note can be
appended to each book by the author as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Laddie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Other books by the same author are <em>Lil</em>, <em>Miss</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>Toosey's mission</em>, <em>Tip cat</em>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>or the style, if preferred, may be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Miss Toosey's mission.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>Other books by the same author are</em> Laddie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lil, Tip cat.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is all the more necessary to follow out this method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> of entry in the
case of sequels to such books. For example there is a book</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lady of the decoration, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and its sequel</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lady married, The, by the Author of "The lady</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of the decoration."</span><br />
</p>

<p>when the books can be entered together and in order of reading as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lady of the decoration, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Lady married, The, by the [same author.]</span><br />
</p>

<p>Other and better-known instances are the books "by the Author of
'Elizabeth and her German Garden.'" Here, however, the identity of the
author has been ascertained, and the books are all brought together in
the ordinary way under her name (Countess von Arnim), and are not put
under "Elizabeth and her German Garden," the entry for which book would
disclose the name of the author and direct to the main-entry (Arnim),
where all her books are to be found.</p>

<p>Further troublesome books are those in which the authors' names are
veiled by initials which may be given on the title-pages or at the
end of the prefaces. The method of entry is much the same as that for
books altogether anonymous, except that either an entry or a reference
is given from the <em>last</em> initial (from the first also if thought to be
required) to the entry word adopted. The full title of the book taken
in illustration reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The makers of Hellas: a critical inquiry into the philosophy
and religion of Ancient Greece, by E.E.G.; with an
introduction, notes, and conclusion by Frank B. Jevons, M.A.,
Litt.D. 1903</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The editor tells us that the author died before the work was in print,
and the author requested him to publish it without revealing the
authorship. Even if the author had lived the book would have appeared
anonymously or under a pseudonym. We may presume that the initials are
those of the author's name, when we have choice of entry as if the
initials were not given, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Makers of Hellas, The: the philosophy and</td>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jevons, Frank B. (<em>Ed.</em>) <em>See</em> Makers of Hellas.</span><br />

<p>or, more conveniently and just as usefully, with an entry instead of a
reference under the initials</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

<p>the reference from the Editor then being changed to</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Jevons</span>, Frank B. (Ed.) <em>See</em> G., E. E.</span><br />
</p>

<p>or, under the circumstances, an entry might be given</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

    <td><span class="smcap">Jevons</span>, Frank B. (<em>Ed.</em>) The makers of Hellas,</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">by E. E. G. 1903</td>
    <td class="tdp1">180</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>when the first entry that under "Makers" can be dispensed with. The
subject-entry is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

    <td><strong>Greece, Ancient</strong>:</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdp6"><em>Philosophy and Religion.</em></td>

<p>and a reference, hardly wanted, but better given</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hellas. <em>See</em> Greece, Ancient.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>An entry of the above character with a bare initial takes precedence
of all the G's in the alphabetical arrangement, and therefore is not
placed as Gee but before Gaa, because the letters following the initial
are an unknown quantity (G&mdash;&mdash;).</p>

<p>In the event, likely enough, of the name covered by the initials being
ascertained, the entry should then be given under the name. Instances
of these are</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the banks of the Seine, by A.M.F., Authoress of "Foreign
courts and foreign homes." 1900</p>

<p>Days and hours in a garden, by "E.V.B." 1884</p></div>

<p>when the authors being known the entries are</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Falls</span>, Alice M. On the banks of the Seine. 1900</span><br />
</p>

<p>or more particularly exact</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">F[alls]</span>, A[lice] M. On the banks of the Seine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">1900</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">B., E.V. <em>See</em> Boyle, E. V.</span><br />
</p>

<p>These books may serve to illustrate more than the one point. The first
does not need a title-entry under "On," and certainly none under
"Banks" or "Seine," as the title is a fanciful one, which is hardly
likely to be remembered in any connection apart from its author and
subject. If a contrary view were taken, the most that could be given
would be this entry:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seine, On the banks of the. Falls, A. M. 1900</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>which is altogether misleading, as the book has nothing to do with
the river, but is a series of sketches of French historical events
occurring in Paris. The correct entry therefore is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>France</strong>:</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">1900</td>
    <td class="tdp1">944</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In contradistinction the second book is most likely to be remembered by
its title as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Days and hours in a garden. Boyle, E. V. 1884</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is one of the forerunners of a long series of books of garden
diaries or essays, containing notes upon flowers, birds, and other
things connected with gardens, and the thoughts they suggest upon a
variety of subjects, and is, by no means, a practical book for the
working gardener. Such books, while inevitably coming under a heading
"Gardens and Gardening," need to be grouped together apart from the
practical books under a sub-division, "Literary Miscellany," or some
other suitable term.</p>

<p>There are books, too, with initials in the place of the authors' names
which obviously do not stand for a name as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Athanasian Creed, by LL.D. 1861</span><br />
</p>

<p>or the last initial is clearly not part of the name, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A sermon preached at the funeral of Lady Mary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Armyne, by J. D., M.A. 1676</span><br />
</p>

<p>The first book is better regarded as entirely anonymous, which it
virtually is, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Athanasian Creed, The, by LL.D. 1861</td>
    <td class="tdp1">238.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>and the second upon the lines previously indicated as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>D., J., <span class="smcap">M.A.</span> A sermon preached at the funeral</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">of Lady Mary Armyne. 1676</td>
    <td class="tdp1">252.9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>or, even better still, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Armyne, Lady Mary, Sermon preached at the</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">funeral of, by J. D., <span class="smcap">M.A.</span> 1676</td>
    <td class="tdp1">252.9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>with the reference, if considered necessary,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">D., J., <span class="smcap">M.A.</span> <em>See</em> Armyne, Lady Mary.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The initials may at times cover a pseudonym when, if this happens to
be unknown, the method of entry would as a matter of course be similar
to that outlined above. If it is known that the initials represent a
pseudonym or phrase-pseudonym, of which A.L.O.E., meaning "A Lady of
England," is a well-known example, then the entry is given under the
first letter and not the last, thus</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"A.L.O.E." (Charlotte M. Tucker). House</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Beautiful; or, the Bible museum. 1868</span><br />
</p>

<p>and following the customary procedure for pseudonym the reference is
given from the real name</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tucker, Charlotte M. <em>See</em> A.L.O.E.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Here again it is recommended to alphabetize as if the first initial
(A) stood alone, and at the beginning of the alphabet rather than as
Aloe. This may not be a matter of much moment, but it is one of those
apparently trivial details which in the aggregate make the catalogue
more accurate, more convenient, and more useful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

The Bible and other Sacred Books. Newspapers, &amp;c.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>"Anonyma" continued. The Bible and other Sacred Books.
Commentaries and Concordances. Newspapers and Periodicals.
Directories and Annuals.</p></div>


<p>There are various books which, while not strictly anonymous, are
regarded for cataloguing as if they were. Some of these have already
been referred to under Societies, but there remain a few others to
consider. Among them are the Bible and other sacred books, the Koran,
the Talmud, the Vedas, etc.</p>

<p>The Bible calls more frequently for attention than any of the others.
All editions of the text or portions of it are entered under the
heading "Bible," and, if they are numerous, the entries are sub-divided
and arranged in this or some similar order:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">a. The whole Bible (whether including the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">apocryphal books or not).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1. Original language. Polyglots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">2. Greek and Latin.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">3. English.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">4. All other languages alphabetically by</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">the names of the languages.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">5. Selections from the Old and New</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Testaments in the order of the</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Books ("Authorised Version").</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">b. The Old Testament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1. Hebrew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">2. English.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">3. Other languages (as before).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">4. Selections from the Old Testament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">c. The New Testament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1. Greek.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">2. English.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">3. Other languages.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">4. Selections from the New Testament.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If there were a number of entries under any one of these sub-divisions,
they would be placed in chronological order by editions. The
selections, if many, would be arranged first by the names of the books,
then by languages, and lastly by editions as before.</p>

<p>A few illustrations typical of the form of entry will be useful.</p>

<p>The New Testament wholly or in parts would be similarly arranged.</p>

<p>All the foregoing remarks apply only to <em>editions of the text</em> as
far as the dictionary catalogue is concerned. Commentaries on the
whole Bible, or on the separate books, follow the customary rules
for main entry, and only come under the general heading of "Bible"
as subject when they deal with the Bible as a whole. Commentaries
upon the Old Testament or the New Testament <em>separately</em> are entered
under "Old Testament" and "New Testament" respectively&mdash;not under
"Bible"; and isolated commentaries upon a particular book under the
name of that book. These points are more clearly shown by examples.
When a commentary covers the whole Bible, or is meant to do so, as
The Speaker's Commentary, The Expositor's Bible, The International
Critical Commentary, The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, and
others, there would be a main-entry under the general editor's name,
and subordinate entries or references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> (entries are better) under the
writers or editors of the separate volumes. The contents of the volumes
must either be set out under the main-entry or under the heading
"Bible."</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp6">rest of the books in the Bible order).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It is literally more correct to set out the contents of these different
volumes under the main-entry (Driver), but it is far more convenient to
give them under "Bible," as above. If given under "Driver," then the
note should be attached to the entry under "Bible."</p>

<p>The different volumes, as said before, are catalogued under the names
of the individual authors, but not under the names of the separate
books when they are part of a general commentary, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Skinner</span>, John. A critical and exegetical commentary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">on Genesis. (<em>International critical</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2"><em>commentary.</em>) 1910</td>
    <td class="tdp1">220.7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>An alternative and briefer form is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Brooke</span>, A. E. International critical commentary:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">The Johannine Epistles. 1912</td>
    <td class="tdp1">220.7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>When a writer has contributed more than one volume to the work the
entries can be amalgamated in this fashion</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Sanday</span>, Wm. International critical commentary:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Synopsis of the four Gospels. The Epistle to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">the Romans. 2 v. 1907-13</td>
    <td class="tdp1">220.7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the event of it being decided to give references instead of entries
under the names of the authors of the separate volumes, such references
must direct to the entry where the contents of the volumes are set out,
otherwise the connection will not be apparent. The contents being under
"Bible" in the above instance, the reference should read</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Skinner</span>, John. <em>See</em> Bible (Commentaries):</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Driver. International critical commentary.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Without the latter part this reference would be too indefinite to be
useful. The entry itself, first shown under Skinner, takes hardly less
space, and is preferable.</p>

<p>When a book is what may be called a monograph-commentary, i.e., a book
standing alone upon a single book or two or three books of the Bible,
it receives the same treatment as would any other work, irrespective of
its connection with the Bible. For example</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Tholuck</span>, A. Commentary on the Gospel of St.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">John. 1860</td>
    <td class="tdp1">226.5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>is placed with any other books upon the Fourth Gospel, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>John, St., Gospel of</strong>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Tholuck, A. Commentary on the Gospel of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">St. John. 1860</td>
    <td class="tdp1">226.5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Monographs of this character are not lost to the inquirer who only
consults the heading "Bible," if the guiding references are provided.</p>

<p>

<p>There is a gain in economy by entering books upon any or all of St.
Paul's Epistles under his name, instead of distributing them under the
names of the churches to which they were addressed. Books to illustrate
this are</p>

</table>

<p>Although the Lightfoot volumes contain the original text of the
Epistles, their value may be said to lie in the notes and dissertations
which bring them under the monograph-commentary arrangement. They may,
further, be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> a single work in three volumes&mdash;as in reality
they are, though it is not so stated on the title-pages. The entries

<p>References can be given from the names of the several Epistles, always
provided there are books upon them under the heading, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Galatians, Epistle to the. <em>See</em> Paul, St.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Those who have but limited space at their disposal may consider that
the principal entries above given under Lightfoot are too full, and
should be reduced. In their case the style given under "Paul, St."
may, with a little amplification, be taken to afford more definite
information, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

<p>The cataloguing of the Bible or its parts, and books upon it, presents
little or no trouble in the classified catalogue, as the systems of
classification are very fully and carefully worked out under this
division, as in Dewey's 220 to 229.</p>

<p>The editions of the sacred books of other religions will not be so many
in most libraries, and consequently need no special consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> The
following two books upon the Koran will suggest the method of entry for
others:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td>Koran, The; transl. from the Arabic by J. M.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">Rodwell. (<em>Everyman's lib</em>.) [1909]</td>
    <td class="tdp1">297</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp4">Wherry, E. M. Commentary on the Qur&aacute;n, comprising</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp6">Sale's translation. 4 v. 1896</td>
    <td class="tdp1">297</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>References are necessary from the names of the religions concerned.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Mohammedanism</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><em>See also</em> Koran.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Varieties of the name, as Qur&aacute;n and Coran, hardly need notice for
reference purposes, as presumably a searcher would not fail to look
under Koran. The same remark applies to Mahomet and Muhammed, though a
reference from Islam to Mohammedanism is desirable. A reference from
Christianity to the Bible would be superfluous.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the main-entry for the Wherry book is not given
under "Koran." The reason for this is the same as that for the books by
Bishop Lightfoot, viz., that the commentary, and not the text, is the
essential part of the work. Therefore the principal entry is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Wherry</span>, E. M. A comprehensive commentary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">on the Qur&aacute;n, comprising Sale's translation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">and preliminary discourse. (<em>Tr&uuml;bner's</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2"><em>Oriental ser.</em>) 4 v. 1896</td>
    <td class="tdp1">297</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>References from the translators named in both the books are essential,
especially as Sale's is the better known, though the reference is more
usefully given to the Koran, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sale, George (<em>transl.</em>) <em>See</em> Koran, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rodwell, J. M. (<em>transl.</em>) <em>See</em> Koran, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Though both of these books belong to series, neither series is of
the character that calls for an entry under its name, unless it be
the "Tr&uuml;bner's Oriental Series." The "Everyman's Library" is too
comprehensive, and both are sufficiently noticed by naming the series
in the main-entries, as shown.</p>

<p>The instructions laid down in some of the codes of rules would seem to
imply that the writers of commentaries should be left in obscurity.
This is not so: they stand upon the same footing as other authors, and
are entitled to the same consideration; their names being adopted for
the main-entry, as shown in the Lightfoot and Wherry examples given
above; unless the commentaries are of so slight a character, being
mere notes, or otherwise occupy so small a place as to be nothing more
than an editing of the text. An instance of this latter type is a book
bearing the title</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sartor resartus: a fully annotated edition with an introductory
essay on Thomas Carlyle, by Rev. James Wood. 1902</p></div>

<p>Carlyle's name does not appear upon the title-page as the author,
probably because it was deemed unnecessary to give it, but it is
rendered simply as</p>

<p>The first of these references contains abbreviated forms of Christian
names, which, as economies, are quite allowable, because they are well
recognised and convey the same meaning as if given in full. Other names
of the kind are Alex., Alf. or Alfd., Chas., Edwd., Eliz., Fredk.,
Geo., Margt., Robt., Saml., Wm., though it is inadvisable to use them
in the transcriptions of book titles; "The marriage of Wm. Ashe," "Sir
Geo. Tressady," "Geo.'s mother," must be avoided.</p>

<p>In the same category as commentaries come concordances, with some
differences of opinion as to the necessity for giving the main-entry
under the compiler's name or the author concordanced. The compiler
is entitled to an acknowledgment of his work, although it is of the
"scissors and paste" order of literature; it is, however, not a matter
of great moment, as under any circumstances both entries are given. The
following are illustrations:</p>

<p>Newspapers, magazines, periodicals, reviews, directories, annuals,
almanacks, and publications of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> like kind are also regarded as
anonymous, and are given a first-word title-entry.</p>

<p>Newspapers of a general character published in London would be entered
in British catalogues without any regard to the place of publication, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Times, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Daily Telegraph, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Westminster Gazette, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Illustrated London News, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p>and not as London Times, London Daily Telegraph, London Westminster
Gazette, London News, Illustrated. Local papers, on the other hand, are
entered under the name of the place, whether the name appears in their
titles or not, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chelsea. West London Press.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Manchester Guardian, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Liverpool. Porcupine, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Leeds Mercury, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The number of volumes and period covered should be given as well as
any change of names the papers have undergone. The editors, even
when known, pass unnoticed, and no general heading of "Newspapers"
(or any other entry) is required except in the classified catalogue,
where all newspapers fall into place under the heading&mdash;in the Dewey
classification 072 (Newspapers&mdash;English).</p>

<p>Magazines and periodicals receive similar treatment, being entered
under the first word of their distinctive titles, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Athen&aelig;um, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dublin Review, The.</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>When newspapers, periodicals, or magazines change their titles without
breaking the continuity of publication, retaining some connection
between their old and new titles, the entries are given under the
latest titles, with references from the earlier if required, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nineteenth Century, The,&mdash;and after.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nation, The (formerly The Speaker).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Speaker, The. <em>See</em> Nation, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The alternative and better form, especially where the periodical has a
separate volume number sequence under each of the titles, is to enter
both as if quite distinct publications, but with notes attached marking
the connection, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

<p>Weekly and monthly periodicals are sometimes the official organs of
learned or scientific societies, in which case the name of the society
becomes the entry word, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Society of Arts, Journal of the.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Royal Geographical Society, Journal of the.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Society of Chemical Industry, Journal of the.</span><br />

<p>References are given, where deemed necessary, from the first word of
the title to the name of the society</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Journal of the Society of Arts. <em>See</em> Society of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Arts.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Publications such as these, and other technical or scientific
periodicals, deserve, and should receive, additional entries under the
names of the subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> with which they are mainly concerned, even if
the subjects are not indicated by their titles. The building papers,
for example, are as much devoted to architecture as to building, and
need subject-entries as well as main-entries, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Architecture</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;"><em>Periodicals.</em></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Architect, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Architectural Review, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">British Architect, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Builder, The.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Building News, The.</span><br />
</p>

<p>So far as the nature of the contents of all these papers goes, they may
fitly be entered in the same manner under "Building"&mdash;<cite>The Architect</cite>
and <cite>The British Architect</cite>, having as much to do with building as
<cite>The Builder</cite> and <cite>The Building News</cite>. To prevent misunderstanding,
it may be explained that the mere titles above are given to show the
method of entry; the number of volumes, dates of publication, or other
particulars must be added in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Directories, annuals, and other "books which are not books," receive
first-word entry as already stated, but a few examples may be cited.</p>

<p>Of these, the first two hardly need further entries, unless they
be under "Doctors" and "Lawyers," the third must be entered under
"Clergy," the fourth, though merely a directory of selected names,
receives a title-entry, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">

    <td>Titled, landed, &amp;c. classes, Kelly's Handbook.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="tdp1">923</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The last two might very well be entered under a heading of
"Statistics"; although not on statistics, they contain much statistical
information. General directories are not entered under a heading
"Directories," but under the names of the places or classes with which
they are concerned.</p>

Miscellaneous.</h2>

<p>Title-Entries. Classics. Specific Subject. Concentration of

Fiction. Novels in Series. Sequels. Fiction Known by
Special Titles. Books with Changed Titles. Annotations.

<p>Without dwelling too much on the various points that seem to need
emphasis, some may be recapitulated with advantage.</p>

<p>There is a great tendency among cataloguers to overdo the title-entries
in a dictionary catalogue, thereby adding to its bulk and cost without
gaining any compensating advantage. One of the chief objections to
the dictionary catalogue is superfluous first-word title-entries. To
give a title-entry is an easy method of disposing of a book when its
precise subject is not readily discerned. To enter books with titles
like <cite>Factors in modern history</cite> under "Factors," <cite>The Winter Queen</cite>
under "Winter," <cite>Romance of the renaissance chateaux</cite> under "Romance,"
<cite>Wanderings by Southern waters</cite> under "Wanderings," <cite>England's case
against Home Rule</cite> under "England's," serves no practical purpose; in
fact often leads to "hotch-potch" like the following:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dutch at Home. By Esquiros</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Dialogues. By Harlen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Dictionary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Figure Painters. By Gower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Guiana. By Palgrave</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Painters. By Stanley</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Pictures. By Sala</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Republic: Address on. By Harrison</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; &mdash; Rise of the. By Motley</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; School of Painting. By Havard</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The second of these alone needed a title-entry, the others should
have been allocated to their proper subjects. Title-entries of this
type are seldom necessary outside works of fiction, volumes of essays
or of poems with specific titles, and a few books that are specially
known by their titles, of which <cite>Eothen</cite>, <cite>Sesame and lilies</cite>, <cite>Sartor
resartus</cite>, are types. Title-entries should be the exception, not the
rule. In the case of classics&mdash;that is "classics" in a wide sense, not
merely the Greek and Latin&mdash;there is rarely any occasion to give more
than the principal entries, the authors being so thoroughly well known
that title-entries or references are redundant. None of Shakespeare's
plays requires a title-entry; no entries are needed under "Iliad"
or "Odyssey," or under "Inferno," or "Divine Comedy," or even under
"Paradise Lost" or "Faust" (for Goethe's).</p>

<p>It is a useful axiom for the cataloguer that he must ascertain clearly
what is the definite subject of a book before he decides upon the
proper subject-heading for it in the dictionary catalogue, as he is
compelled to do before he can assign the exact place for a book in
the classified catalogue. Further, he should not attach too much
importance to the terms of the title-page in the process, else he will
stumble on "pitfalls" in the shape of titles that may mislead, and
so be induced to place a book on artificial lighting with the title
"The art of illumination" under the wrong kind of "Illuminating," an
"Essay on Irish bulls" under "Cattle," "The psychology of socialism"
under "Mind," and "The Fine Art of Jujutsu" under "Art," even misread
"Jujutsu" as the name of an artist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>As already stated, it is well to avoid scattering books upon a single
subject, even if viewed from varying standpoints, under several
headings throughout the catalogue, if they can be reasonably brought
together, and the fact that the books are in different languages must
not be allowed to affect the matter. As a case in point, we may take
such a subject of the day as "Tariff Reform." It is both possible and
desirable to concentrate under some appropriate and inclusive heading,
say "Free Trade Question" or "Tariffs," the books for and against free
trade; embodying under it those dealing with special aspects of the
question, instead of scattering them, on account of the terms used
on their title-pages, under "Protection," "Food Taxes," "Imperial
Preference," "Tariffs," "Fiscal Question," "Tariff Reform," "Fair
Trade," "Reciprocity," etc. When these terms occur in the titles, a
reference from them to the heading can easily be given if thought
desirable. Omitting the principal entries, this may be illustrated by
showing several books of apparently very different views that really
bear upon this question, and justify inclusion under it.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Free Trade Question</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ashley, P. Modern tariff history. 1904</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Aubry, P. Etude critique de la politique</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">commerciale de l'Angleterre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1904</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Avebury, Lord. Free trade. 1904</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Taussig, F. W. The tariff history of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">the United States. 1901</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Unwin, Mrs. C. (<em>Ed.</em>) The hungry</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">forties. 1904</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Williams, E. E. The case for protection.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">1899</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash; "Made in Germany." 1896</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Williamson, A. British industries</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">and foreign competition. 1894</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>This also serves to show the convenience of fixing upon some term of
a permanent character for a subject-heading, and so "ear-marking" it
by means of cross-references that synonymous headings cannot occur. It
may be argued that these terms are not strictly synonymous, indeed, are
mostly opposites, Free Trade not being Tariff Reform or Protection.
It must be remembered that every book upon such a subject contains
something on the other side of the question, therefore bringing books
together in this fashion certainly gives a whole view of the subject.
Were the entries numerous under the heading, they could be divided to
show the books advocating free trade and those against. There are other
subjects that lend themselves to similar treatment, as for example that
shown on page <a href="#Page_109">109</a>. Where the terms used are undoubtedly synonymous,
definite choice of one has to be made, and the cross-reference given
from the other; Ethics or Moral Philosophy, Political Economy or
Economics, Physics or Natural Philosophy, and so on; the more modern or
commonly used terms being preferable, as Ethics, Economics, Physics.</p>

<p>Popular, rather than scientific or technical, names should be chosen
for subject-headings, especially for the catalogues of libraries used
by all classes of the community&mdash;Spiders not Arachnida, Worms not
Annelida, Fishes not Ichthyology, Crime (Punishment, etc., of) not
Penology, Stamp-Collecting not Philately, Consumption not Phthisis.
Care must be taken that the popular term means the same thing&mdash;thus a
book upon alg&aelig; cannot be entered under "Sea-weeds" if it includes the
freshwater species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also customary to avoid the use of foreign terms if there are
English equivalents, but this is not always the case&mdash;"jiu-jitsu" (or
"jujutsu"), for example, has no word in English meaning the same thing.</p>

<p>It is trite and commonplace to say that there is much reliable history
written in the form of fiction, and a great deal of fiction in the
guise of serious books: this being so, the cataloguer is well advised
to reckon with it. Whether we shall notice all novels "with a purpose"
opens too wide a question, but many are not only true to life but are
real history, and meant to be so. For example, a recently published book</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Diver</span>, Maud. The hero of Herat.</span><br />
</p>

<p>while ostensibly a novel, is a biography, which may be read as such,
of Major Eldred Pottinger, who devoted his life to furthering British
interests on the Indian frontier. Another book of the kind, nominally
fiction yet virtually a life of Hamilton, the American statesman, is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Atherton</span>, Gertrude F. The Conqueror.</span><br />
</p>

<p>On the other hand, works of historical romance are got up in size and
appearance, including the provision of portraits as illustrations, to
range with histories and biographies, and thus they deceive the unwary,
who are apt to regard them as authoritative and genuine, although
perhaps it is not the intention of the author that they should be so
regarded. Such a book is</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Hare</span>, Christopher" (Mrs. Andrews.) Isabella</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of Milan, Princess d'Aragona, and wife of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza: the intimate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">story of her life in Milan. 1911</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>While written in the form of letters, it is pure romance, with an
historical basis.</p>

<p>In the ordinary way these books would receive quite different
treatment, even for the classified catalogue. For the dictionary
catalogue the books palpably novels would have title-entries given
them, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hero of Herat, The. Diver, M.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Conqueror, The. Atherton, G. F.</span><br />
</p>

<p>whereas the larger-sized book receives a subject-entry as a serious
book,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Isabella of Milan, Princess d'Aragona, &amp;c.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hare, C. 1911</span><br />
</p>

<p>and would be placed with historical biography in the classified
catalogue.</p>

<p>This raises the important question whether the cataloguer is ever
justified in giving subject-entries for works of fiction, especially
historical romances. Much depends upon the nature and quality of the
book. When it can be read as a contribution to the subject or period
with which it deals, without being to any extent misleading, then it
may fairly and usefully receive a subject-entry. Where so entered, it
will prevent misunderstanding if a note (annotation) is appended to
the entry, stating that the work is in fiction form. A schoolmaster,
who was versed in the life of Sir Thomas More, read Anne Manning's
"The household of Sir Thomas More" more than once, and could hardly be
convinced that it was a work of fiction.</p>

<p>Catalogued according to the suggestions here outlined, the entries for
the works of fiction would be</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Diver</span>, Maud. The Hero of Herat: a frontier</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">biography in romantic form.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Though in fiction form the book is a biography</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">of Major Eldred Pottinger, who devoted his life</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">to furthering British interests on the frontier of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">India.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pottinger, Major Eldred, The Hero of Herat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Diver, M.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">A novel embodying Pottinger's life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Atherton</span>, Gertrude F. The Conqueror: being</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">the true and romantic story of Alexander</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hamilton.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Life of Hamilton, the American statesman, in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">fiction form.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Hamilton, Alexander</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Atherton, G. F. The Conqueror.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Fiction, incorporating Hamilton's life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Manning</span>, Anne. The household of Sir Thomas</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">More.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">A story based on More's life.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>More, Sir Thomas</strong>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Manning, A. The household of Sir Thomas</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">More.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">A story founded on fact.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks not only relate to historical fiction, but also
to other works that are undoubtedly contributions to their subjects
apart from the form in which they are written. A book just published is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="example">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, Leslie. Vagabond days in Brittany.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdp2">illus. 1913</td>
    <td class="tdp1">944.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The preface opens with a statement to the effect that "although the
book is cast in the form of a story, all the facts about Brittany and
her people are true, and may be relied upon by those who care to use
the work as a guide-book." This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> warrants an entry under the subject
"Brittany," and justifies the Dewey number given to it.</p>

<p>If the proportion of fiction outweighs the fact so largely that the
book is valueless except as romance, it is wiser to limit the entries
to author and title. It is possible (but undesirable) to enter all the
works of fiction dealing with a particular person, or epoch, or event,
under the subjects, but they should be kept apart from serious works,
under a sub-heading marking them distinctly as fiction. Valuable helps
in this connection are Dr. E. A. Baker's <cite>Guide to the Best Fiction</cite>
and <cite>Historical Fiction</cite>.</p>

<p>When novels belong to a connected series, and are meant to be read in
a particular order, it is helpful to indicate the order of reading.
French fiction is noteworthy in this respect, Balzac's <cite>Sc&egrave;nes de
la vie</cite>, Zola's <cite>Les Rongon-Macquart</cite>, Ohnet's <cite>Les batailles de la
vie</cite>, and Rolland's <cite>Jean-Cristophe</cite>, may be named as examples. In
English fiction we have Trollope's <cite>Chronicles of Barsetshire</cite> and Mrs.
Oliphant's <cite>Chronicles of Carlingford</cite>. A recent example is that of Mr.
Hugh Walpole, whose novels are arranged in order of sequence in this way</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Walpole</span>, Hugh. Studies in place:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The wooden horse.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Maradick at forty.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Prologues to "The rising city":</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The prelude to adventure.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fortitude.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The rising city.</span><br />
</p>

<p>They can be given in this order in the catalogue, instead of
alphabetically, for the reason that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> a general title is accorded to
the series. Title-entries are required in the customary manner under
"Wooden," "Maradick," "Mr.," "Prelude," "Fortitude," "Rising," but not
under "Studies in place" or "Prologues."</p>

<p>The order of reading of sequels is indicated by means of notes to the
entries, as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Wood</span>, Mrs. Henry. The Channings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Roland Yorke.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sequel to the above.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Dumas</span>, Alexandre. Chicot the jester.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sequel to <cite>Marguerite de Valois</cite>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Forty-five guardsmen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sequel to <cite>Marguerite de Valois</cite> and <cite>Chicot the</cite></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><cite>jester</cite>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; Marguerite de Valois.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The sequels are <cite>Chicot the Jester</cite> and <cite>Forty-five</cite></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><cite>guardsmen</cite>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes the books are placed in the order they are intended to be
read, and numbered accordingly. The first comes into place in its
alphabetical order of title, and the rest follow irrespective of the
alphabetical order, after this manner</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Dumas</span>, Alexandre. The Chevalier d'Harmental</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 1. The companions of Jehu</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 2. The first republic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 1. The conspirators</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 2. The Regent's daughter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The Count of Monte-Cristo</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; The last Vend&eacute;e; or, the she-wolves of Machecoul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 1. Marguerite de Valois</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 2. Chicot the jester</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash; 3. Forty-five guardsmen</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is not so desirable a form as the notes appended to the entries,
because it is less clear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> meaning. It also needs an explanatory note
that the books are numbered in the order of sequence, otherwise it will
not be understood that each series of numbers stands apart from the
rest.</p>

<p>At this point it may be mentioned that well-known works of fiction are
often more familiarly known by short titles than by what may be called
their official titles, especially if those titles include proper names.
This has to be taken into account for title-entries, if not in the main
entries. Accordingly "The life and adventures of Robinson Crusoe" is
entered as "Robinson Crusoe," "The posthumous papers of the Pickwick
Club" as "Pickwick Papers," and "The personal history and experience of
David Copperfield the Younger" as "David Copperfield."</p>

<p>Books with changed titles are among the "pitfalls" that beset the
path of the librarian, and call for special alertness on the part of
the cataloguer. Three such books came under notice on a single day
recently, and are here named, as they show the difficulty of preventing
the acquisition of duplicates and of the consequent addition of
superfluous entries to the catalogue. An American edition of a novel by
Agnes and Egerton Castle, entitled <cite>The heart of Lady Anne</cite>, was duly
catalogued by that title until found to be the same book as <cite>French
Nan</cite> (American editions are troublesome in this respect); Anderson's
<cite>The a b c of artistic photography in theory and practice</cite> (1913)
was found to be identical with his <cite>The artistic side of photography</cite>
(1908); and Norton's <cite>Bible student's handbook of Assyriology</cite> (1913)
to be merely a new edition of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><cite>Popular handbook of useful and
interesting information for beginners in the elementary study of
Assyriology</cite> (1908).</p>

<p>A most commendable feature of modern cataloguing is the explanatory
notes and other annotations appended to catalogue entries. These are
for the most part to be found in the lists of additions to libraries
published monthly, quarterly, or annually; such publications lending
themselves readily to this descriptive form of cataloguing. The
classified catalogue has also the advantage over the dictionary form
for this purpose, because, rarely having more than a single entry for
each book, the question as to where the note is to go does not arise.
The dictionary catalogue having two or more entries, the addition of
annotations enlarges it materially, besides presenting the difficulty
of deciding to which of the entries the note is to be attached,
if not to all. Some notes are better under the author-entry, and
others are more appropriate to the subject. Nevertheless, some fully
annotated dictionary catalogues have been issued, notably Mr. C. W. F.
Goss's catalogues of the Bishopsgate Institute Library and Mr. W. E.
Doubleday's Hampstead Public Library catalogues.</p>

<p>When annotations are given, they should be pithy, to the point, and,
as far as possible, free from criticism. A bookseller may have some
strong religious leanings or political opinions which he can afford
to publish by means of notes in his catalogues without anybody being
more than amused thereby, but the wise public official, as the servant
of all creeds and parties, will respect all alike, and take care, if
only for his own sake, that he does not hurt the susceptibilities of
any. He will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> his personal opinions to himself in a "water-tight"
compartment, where they cannot affect or influence his public work,
whether it be in cataloguing or in book-selection. It is greatly to
the credit of public librarians that they pursue this policy as a mere
matter of course, their training enabling them to view all literature
broadly, without prejudice or any reference to the bias of the contents
of books. To say this, does not mean that a cataloguer may not attach a
note to a controversial book of any kind indicating the point of view
taken by the author, but he should do so without expressing his own
opinion.</p>

<p>Some annotations are nothing more than a repetition or paraphrase of
the title-page, and so add nothing to the information contained in the
catalogue entry. They appear to be given upon the supposition that
every book in an annotated catalogue must have an annotation, but this
is a mistake, as the majority of title-pages admirably summarize the
contents of books, for which purpose they exist. It is when they fail
to do this, or do it indefinitely, or when the book has some especial
feature not noticed in the title to which it is worth while directing
attention, that the annotation is required and proves of value.</p>

<p>Other features enter into the composition of an annotation. Brevity is
not only the soul of it, but is absolutely essential if a catalogue
is to be kept within bounds. A note based upon a review should
avoid any appearance of partiality, as reviewers are not invariably
impartial. It is helpful to readers to get some rough idea of the
amount of knowledge needed to understand a book&mdash;for example, a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
dealing with astronomy mathematically would be above the heads of most
people, and when a work is of this nature it should be so stated.
The qualifications of an author for writing upon a subject are often
noted&mdash;he may be a professor of the subject at a university, or have
some other position or some experience that marks him as an authority.
This, perhaps, is not of first-rate importance, as it may be presumed
that no one would write a book upon a subject of which he knows
nothing, or who is not qualified in some way to deal with it; a kindly,
if not always correct, view to take. Summed up, the whole object of
an annotation is to assist in the choice of a book, and to elucidate
the treatment of its subject, though it may be said that the purpose
is defeated in these days when so many opportunities for examining the
book itself exist. The subject is exhaustively dealt with in Mr. E. A.
Savage's <cite>Manual of Descriptive Annotations for Library Catalogues</cite>.
The following are typical examples of annotations selected from various
sources:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>McCarthy</strong>, Justin. Story of Gladstone's life.</span><br />

<p>Whether a catalogue makes any pretence of being annotated or not, every
library contains books with some features that render them unique or
almost so, when it is worth while showing this by means of a note
attached to the entries as a matter of course. The books may be in
manuscript, be works of the early printers, be extra illustrated, or
be first editions of some value, and these facts are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> stated.
The two following are taken from a catalogue containing no annotations
except such as may be characterised as inevitable:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">She Bible from Ruth iii. 15.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Other forms of notes that are unavoidable have already been indicated,
as for example, those denoting the order of reading for sequels, and
the amount of reliable history in works of fiction.</p>

<p>In the previous pages it has been more or less hinted that form
entries&mdash;that is, entries for books written in a particular literary
form, as poetry, drama, essays, fiction&mdash;are out of place in a
dictionary catalogue, and to introduce them is to drag in sections from
the classified catalogue which do not suitably fit. While it is an
exaggeration to say that if books in poetical form are to be entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
under the heading "Poetry," then it logically follows that prosy books
require a heading "Prose," or if novels and romances are to be entered
under "Fiction," then serious books should be placed under "Fact";
there is, all the same, a certain amount of truth behind it. If a
poetical work has a general title, as "Poems" or "Poetical Works," then
there is no need to do more than enter it under the author's name; if
it has a distinctive title, a title-entry is given in addition. This
also applies to dramas and dramatic works, and to volumes of sermons,
letters, or essays. The method of dealing with volumes of essays has
been more definitely shown in Chapter VI., and with works of fiction in
other chapters. Volumes of letters or sermons bearing upon a definite
subject are entered for subject as any other books, the form not
signifying.</p>

<p>Beginners in cataloguing may find the following direct and simple hints
or rules useful for treating subjects in a dictionary catalogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1.&mdash;Clearly ascertain what is the definite subject of a book
before cataloguing it.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Do not rely entirely upon the wording of the title-page.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Fix permanently the name adopted for a subject and in such
a way that synonymous headings cannot occur.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Bring together all books upon the same subject irrespective
of the language in which they are written.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Adopt popular terms in preference to scientific for
subject-headings, if the Library is intended to be used
by all classes of the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>6.&mdash;Make sure that the popular term has the same meaning as the
scientific, and is as comprehensive.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;Avoid scattering books upon a single subject, though viewed
from different standpoints, under several headings, if
they can be concentrated under one heading.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Avoid entries under first or other word of the title as far
as possible, where a subject-entry is all that is needed.
Title-entries should be the exception not the rule.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Make a subject-heading when there are two or more books
upon the same subject; when only one gives a subject
title-entry.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Series entries are to be given as such and not as a
makeshift form of subject-entry.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;Form entries, generally speaking, are out of place in the
dictionary catalogue. If given they are better relegated
to an appendix.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;References and cross-references should be always
subordinate and connected.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;References are rarely given from lesser to greater
subjects, but should not be overlooked from greater to
lesser.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;In no case should references be given from author to
subject or vice versa, or in any form not distinctly
relative, otherwise they are apt to be incongruous.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;Volumes of a collective or miscellaneous character require
that each item be considered and catalogued as if a
separate work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>16.&mdash;Works of a marked classical character are not considered
to require title entries, and seldom need subject-entries.</p>

<p>17.&mdash;Works of fiction with proper names in their titles call
for consideration as to the best form of title-entry.</p>

<p>18.&mdash;When a book deals with a subject with a geographical
limitation, choice between subject and geographical
heading is sometimes necessary for the sake of economy.
When in doubt give both entries.</p>

<p>19.&mdash;The above rule can be departed from in the case of the
home country.</p>

<p>20.&mdash;The judicious abbreviation of entries is not so simple as
it appears on the surface and requires care.</p>

<p>21.&mdash;Alphabetical arrangement is <em>not</em> by any means as simple
as a b c.</p>

<p>22.&mdash;The use of repetition dashes should be strictly limited,
and never exceed two under any circumstances.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

The Printing of Catalogues.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The Preparation of "Copy." Markings for Type. Styles of
Printing in Various Catalogues. Table of Types. Tenders for
Printing. Model Specification. Reading and Correction of
Proofs. Type "Kept Standing."</p></div>


<p>The preparation of the manuscript of the catalogue for the press, and
the reading and correction of proofs, call for great care on the part
of the cataloguer, if the results of his labours are to be entirely
satisfactory when in print.</p>

<p>The slips being all sorted into exact order, it is well to paste them
down on sheets of paper, to make the "copy" for the printer. Any kind
of paper serves the purpose, provided it is strong and the sheets
are uniform in size; back numbers of periodicals, if on good paper,
do quite well. When the entries in the dictionary catalogue under
a subject-heading are fairly numerous, they are sub-divided before
they are pasted down; the entries themselves usually suggesting the
appropriate sub-headings&mdash;or "arrangement according to material." Some
sub-divisions have been added to the illustrative entries in these
pages to show this. The headings of the second and subsequent entries
under an author's name, and under a subject, are cut away before the
slips are pasted down, or they must be scored through afterwards;
watchful care has to be exercised lest too much be cut off the slips
at this time. If the catalogue is classified the numerical symbols are
interpreted, and such class-headings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> divisions, and sub-divisions
written as are required to be printed. The sheets of paper should be
pasted and the slips laid on them and rubbed down, instead of pasting
each slip separately.</p>

<p>Should the catalogue entries be written or typed on good cards,
inconvenient to paste down, or which it is desired to preserve, they
can be numbered consecutively and strung together for the printer;
anything upon them not meant to be printed being marked out, including
in this case also the headings of second and subsequent entries under a
single heading and an author's name.</p>

<p>Whether sent on separate cards or as pasted sheets, each entry must
be marked for the sizes and styles of type the printer is to use. The
following is a convenient and recognised method of doing this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For CAPITALS underline three times in black ink.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Small Capitals</span> underline twice in black ink.</p>

<p>For <em>Italics</em> underline once in black ink.</p>

<p>For <strong style="font-family:clarendon">Clarendon</strong>, <strong style="font-family:antique">Antique</strong>, or other heavy type
underline as before but in red.</p>

<p>For <span class="small">smaller type</span> than the body of the catalogue mark the
portions down the margin with a vertical line.</p></div>

<p>Various considerations enter into the question of the style or
"get-up" (i.e., size, types, paper, binding) of the catalogue. In all
rate-supported libraries the foremost of these is the expense involved.
Owing to the disconnected nature of catalogue entries the setting is
somewhat troublesome work for the compositor, and, taking longer time
than straightforward work, costs more, though the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> type-setting
machines, Linotype and Monotype, have facilitated the work. It is a
well-known fact in connection with public libraries that the public
will not pay more than a merely nominal sum for a catalogue, and
certainly nothing approaching the cost of printing&mdash;to be compelled to
sell a catalogue for 6d. which cost 1s. 6d. or 2s. per copy to produce
is a common experience. Sometimes the difference in cost is made good
by advertisements, though this is an unreliable source of revenue.
Advertisers do not regard a catalogue as a good medium for this purpose
owing to the small number in an edition; the fact that it is in
constant use does not weigh much with them. If advertisements can be
dispensed with so much the better, as they detract from the appearance
of a catalogue even if they do not actually disfigure it. The extent
of the library catalogued also enters into the matter. A small one not
requiring a large catalogue can use larger type in printing, though a
small library and a small income often go together, when strict economy
has to be exercised. Again there is the question of including the books
of the reference department in the catalogue, making it a general one,
which adds to its bulk and cost. The reference books having to be used
upon the premises are quite sufficiently brought under notice by means
of the card or sheaf form of catalogues, typewritten or in manuscript,
now in general use, though it may be desirable for a newly-established
library to have a complete catalogue of all departments. Those
persons who understand a "reference department" to consist of a
few directories, dictionaries, and almanacks, may thus learn that
it comprises much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> more. The extent of the collection also affects
this, as it is desirable, if not actually necessary, that the printed
catalogue shall be kept within such limits as to be portable, and in
a single volume, because some people prefer to have their own copies
rather than make use of those provided in the library, and others make
their choice of books solely at home. All this applies more especially
to the catalogues of lending libraries, as, generally speaking, printed
catalogues of reference libraries are seldom seen nowadays&mdash;they are
more of a luxury than a necessity.</p>

<p>The illustrative examples throughout this work give an idea of the
styles of types recommended, though the choice is more one of usage
or personal preference. The following examples, taken from various
catalogues, are selected as representing the styles of printing usually
met with in catalogues.</p>

<p>A common and very economical form is set in 8-point (or brevier)
old-style type, with authors' names, when leading, in small capitals,
the subject-headings in antique, with the entries under them in 6-point
(or nonpareil) as well as all contents and annotations. It is printed
in double columns with a double rule dividing the columns, and on a
royal octavo page:&mdash;</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this style is the over-emphasis of authors' names
at the cost of subject-headings, which are somewhat obscured instead
of being made prominent. The general appearance is not good, the page
having a "spotty" look.</p>

<p>The next example is much the same in character as the first, except
that it is set in modern-faced type, the shelf numbers are given in
heavy type, and the gauge is different. On the whole it presents a
pleasing appearance, though the punctuation is unusual:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old-style" in type does not mean old-fashioned, but the more artistic
and readable type modelled on the lettering of the early printers,
principally those of the Italian presses, and is that most preferred
at present. If anything, modern-faced type is the older fashioned.
Fantastic or decorated types, even for initial capitals at the
commencement of a division of the catalogue, are better avoided. The
following is an example somewhat after the style of the second given
above, but applied to a classified catalogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>When varying sizes of type are used for distinctive purposes, the
contrast is better brought about by using for the smaller type one
which is two sizes under that of the body of the catalogue. Thus if
10-point (or long primer) is used, then 8-point (or brevier) is taken
for the small type rather than 9-point (or bourgeois), which would not
be sufficiently distinctive. All the above examples are in 8-point (or
brevier) with 6-point (or nonpareil) for the small size. The following
table of types and the space they occupy is useful for reference:&mdash;</p>

<p>Where cost has not to be considered, a better effect is obtained by
printing a catalogue across the page instead of in double columns. This
takes up nearly twice as much space, given the same size of type, and
is usually printed in demy octavo size (8&frac12; inches by 5&frac12;). If the number
of entries is large the catalogue makes a thick volume, though this
depends largely upon the size of type used. The following example is
taken from a class-list printed in 8-point (or brevier) with notes and
contents in 6-point (or nonpareil) as in the double-columned catalogues
shown above:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is with the object of using larger-sized types that catalogues are
printed across the page, as the double-columned catalogue does not
admit of the use of large type without adopting a wide page, which is
somewhat inconvenient. The next three examples are of the larger-type
character:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> The following is set in 9-point (bourgeois) with the
contents and notes in 5-point (or pearl). The setting of works of
fiction in double columns is an economical feature, as the short titles
of this class of literature permit a saving. The catalogue from which
it is taken, including preface and key to the indicator of 50 pages,
contains 760 pages for a lending library of just under 20,000 volumes:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are other sizes of catalogues from a quarto to a duodecimo, so
far as the size of the pages is concerned, but the above examples
include all sizes of type that it is advisable to use; anything larger
than 11-point (small pica) being too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> large, and anything smaller than
6-point (nonpareil) is hardly readable. Brevier, or the nearest to
it, 8-point, is a useful and economical size, as examination of the
foregoing examples proves, and while it is comparatively small it must
be remembered that catalogues are merely looked at and not read through
in the ordinary meaning of the term.</p>

<p>The styles of types having been settled, it is customary to invite
tenders for the work from printing firms selected because of their
repute, experience, and ability to carry out such work. The possibility
of securing a satisfactory or economical piece of work is very remote
if it is open to all who choose to tender, even within a local area.
The cheapest tender obtained in this way frequently proves the dearest
in the end, to say nothing of the worry and vexation caused to the
librarian by people undertaking work they have not the material or
competence to execute properly. All firms must tender upon the same
basis, and therefore it is essential that a specification be prepared
for the purpose. The following is prepared for the style of printing
first mentioned (page <a href="#Page_220">220</a>), though it can be easily altered in this
and other respects to suit requirements. It is fairer to all concerned
if a specimen page is set up embodying the cataloguer's intentions and
all the styles of type it is proposed to use as nearly as possible in
the right proportions, though this is not of first-rate importance
if the various sizes to be used are separately priced and measured
up for payment at the completion of the work. It must be remembered
that though smaller type occupies less space it costs more to compose
than the larger. It is also an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> advantage to have some portion of the
manuscript ("copy") ready in order that a printer tendering may examine
it and judge of its nature if he so desires.</p>


<p class="center">[<em>Specification for Printing.</em>]</p>

<p class="center">COUNTY BOROUGH OF BIBLIOVILLE.</p>

<p class="center">Specification for Printing a Catalogue of the Public
Library.
</p>

<p>The Committee of the Public Library invite tenders for printing a
catalogue of their Lending Library upon the following conditions:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Edition and Size.</em>&mdash;The edition to consist of three thousand
copies, royal octavo in size (not less than 9&frac14; by 6 when
bound).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The number of the edition depends entirely upon
local circumstances and probable sales. A library of 5,000
borrowers will take about seven years to sell 3,500 copies of a
catalogue at 6d. per copy.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Paper.</em>&mdash;To be at least 32lbs. royal to the ream, of good
finish, white, uniform in tint throughout.</p>

<p><em>Type and Setting.</em>&mdash;8-point Old-style, with occasional small
capitals, italics, and Clarendon or antique, with 6-point
for subjects,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> notes, and contents, and the proper
accented letters in foreign languages. To be set solid, two
columns to the page, seventy lines 8-point to the column
(apart from page-heading, which is to contain a title and
catch-word syllables), each fifteen ems wide, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>double
division rules between. Turnover lines to be indented one
em, the repeat dash to be a one em rule, the class-letter
and number to stand clear four ems, the 6-point indent to
be two ems. Spaces between the end of the book-entry and
the class-letter to be filled with leaders. The type must
not be worn or broken, and must be free from wrong-founts.
The "copy" must be closely followed for the punctuation and
use of capitals.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> If the entries under subject-headings are to be in
smaller type.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Machining.</em>&mdash;The sheets to be well worked in perfect register,
with good ink and uniform impression, afterwards rolling or
pressing if needed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Good printers do not now need to hot press or
roll the sheets.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Time.</em>&mdash;From the first receipt of copy, the work to be
proceeded with at a rate of not less than two sheets of
sixteen pages each per week until completed [or in default
thereof the printer to pay a sum of two pounds per week as
damages.]</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A penalty clause is optional; much depends upon
the printer, who may be very dilatory and use the work to fill
up with when not otherwise busy.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Proofs.</em>&mdash;Two copies of proof in galley and two copies of a
revise in page to be furnished for reading and correction.
The Librarian to have the right to demand a revise in
galley and such revises in page as he shall deem necessary.
No sheet to be sent to press until ordered by the
endorsement of the Librarian thereon.</p>

<p><em>Additions and corrections.</em>&mdash;The Librarian to have the right
to insert additional matter in galley but not in page
except as an author's correction. No extra charge to be
allowed for author's corrections unless pointed out and
priced at the time they are made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Number of pages.</em><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;The number of pages is estimated to
be 250 more or less, but this is not guaranteed, and no
allowance will be made for any miscalculation in this
respect.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> An estimate made from the "copy" is liable to turn
out wrong when the work is in type, the tendency being
to overstate the number of pages, when the printer is
within his rights, according to trade usages, in claiming
for profit upon the full number of pages upon which his
estimate is based; therefore it is wise to leave the matter
open in this way.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Covers.</em>&mdash;Three thousand covers to be printed upon coloured
paper of an approved tint, not less than 34lbs. to the ream
(royal). The front of this cover to be printed with the
title of the catalogue.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;If the catalogue is not to be bound in boards,
but is to have paper covers only, the weight of the paper
should be at least 70lbs.</p></div>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Binding.</em>&mdash;The whole edition is to be bound in good
strawboards of suitable thickness, with cloth strip backs,
and strongly sewn with thread, the covers being pasted on
the front and back and the whole cut flush. Fourteen days
will be allowed for binding after the last sheet has been
returned for the press.</p>

<p><em>Delivery.</em>&mdash;The catalogues when completed are to be securely
tied up in brown paper parcels of fifty each and delivered
to the Librarian at the Public Library.</p>

<p><em>Tender.</em>&mdash;The tender is to state the price per page for
8-point and for 6-point type respectively, this price to
be inclusive of all charges for press corrections, covers,
binding, and delivery as aforesaid. When completed the
work is to be measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> up, and charges will be allowed
according to the quantity used of each of the above types.
Payment will be made within three months afterwards.</p>

<p><em>Other conditions.</em>&mdash;The work is to be executed to the entire
satisfaction of the Librarian, and if he is dissatisfied
with it in any respect he is authorised to stop the work
and refer the matter to the Library Committee for their
decision, which shall be final and binding.</p>

<p><em>Contract.</em>&mdash;The Committee may require the firm whose tender is
accepted to enter into a contract with the Borough Council
to carry out the work in accordance with this specification
and its conditions, and to give an undertaking that the
rate of wages paid and hours of labour observed are those
that are generally accepted as fair by the printing trades.</p></div>

<p>The Committee do not bind themselves to accept the lowest or any tender.</p>

<p>Specimens of the kind of work required can be inspected at the
Librarian's office, where also the "copy" can be seen as far as ready.</p>

<p>Tenders, with samples of the papers proposed to be used, are to be sent
in sealed envelopes, endorsed "Catalogue," to reach the undersigned not
later than noon on the 5th day of November, 1913.</p>

<p>The preliminaries having been settled, the work of printing is put in
hand by furnishing the printer with a supply of "copy," of say 100
sheets, duly marked for varieties of type and other details. In due
course the printer will send two or three copies of proofs printed in
single column on long strips of paper known as "galleys," with ample
margins on which to mark the corrections. The corrections are not
marked on the printed matter alone, but the nature of the correction
required is also marked in the margin. An assistant, possessing some
knowledge of the subject, should read out the "copy" slowly and
distinctly to the cataloguer, at the same time directing attention to
any peculiarities of spelling, punctuation, accented letters, and the
like. It is a very difficult task to correct the proofs by reference to
the "copy" without having it read aloud. Each galley having been once
read through should have the shelf numbers called again, as mistakes
in these cause most trouble. After this the cataloguer will be well
advised to read the galleys through carefully once more, apart from the
"copy," provided he can spare the time, and is not overwhelmed with
proofs by the printer. He should also mark the places for the insertion
of any additions, which are either written on the margins or, if large
in number, made into a new sheet of "copy," with a separate numbering
for each item, this numbering being used for marking the exact place
where it is to be inserted.</p>

<p>When the corrections are many, as they often are in the early stages
of the work before the compositor has got into the right way, it is
advisable to have "a revise" in galley&mdash;that is, an additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> "pull"
after the corrections are made. Should the corrections be comparatively
few, the printer may safely be trusted to put them right, and a revise
in page form will suffice. This revise in page needs careful reading
for catch-letters and other page headings, and for the repetition of
authors' names and subject-headings when they are divided at the tops
of columns (or pages). This reading is done without the "copy," which,
once being read, is not needed again, except for reference.</p>

<p>Most catalogues are now set up on the Linotype or Monotype machines,
when it is as well to ascertain which of these machines is in use. By
the Linotype a single addition of a word or correction of a letter
involves the resetting of the whole line, possibly two, and the lines
must be re-read. Corrections on the Monotype are made by single pieces
in the ordinary way. It is essential in hand-setting to look out for
wrong founts, that is pieces of another size or style of type which
have been accidentally mixed up with that being used, and if printed
will mar the appearance. Broken and worn letters also should be marked
to be changed. Work on the type-setting machines is not so much subject
to these faults, though they are possible. The method of correcting a
proof and the signs used in the process are shown in Appendix A.</p>

<p>With the object of saving expense in the printing of new editions of
catalogues, some librarians are trying the experiment of keeping the
type standing and paying a small rental. The edition printed is then
not so large as usual, and when a new edition is required the type is
again used and the new additions inserted. An arrangement of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
requires that the original estimate shall include a price per page for
reprints with additions and for re-imposition. This attempt at economy
has not yet got beyond the experimental stage.</p>

<p>The storage of type until wanted for reprinting does not enter
into consideration where the Monotype setting machine is used, the
perforated paper rolls being easily filed away until required again;
though this is rather the concern of the printer than of the librarian.</p>

<p>We may conclude with the following quotation taken from the preface of
a library catalogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the former catalogue it was said that 'It would seem to be
impossible to produce a catalogue absolutely free from errors
of compilation or the press, and some are already noted for
correction when the next edition is called for.' This statement
still holds good."</p></div>
